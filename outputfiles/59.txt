The Astros’ Sign-Stealing Scandal
Major League Baseball (MLB) fosters an extremely competitive environment. Tens of millions
of dollars in salary (and endorsements) can hang in the balance, depending on whether a player
performs well or poorly. Likewise, hundreds of millions of dollars of value are at stake for the
owners as teams vie for World Series glory. Plus, fans, players and owners just want their team
to win. And everyone hates to lose!
It is no surprise, then, that the history of big-time baseball is dotted with cheating scandals
ranging from the Black Sox scandal of 1919 (“Say it ain’t so, Joe!”), to Gaylord Perry’s spitter, to
the corked bats of Albert Belle and Sammy Sosa, to the widespread use of performance
enhancing drugs (PEDs) in the 1990s and early 2000s. Now, the Houston Astros have joined this
inglorious list.
Catchers signal to pitchers which type of pitch to throw, typically by holding down a certain
number of fingers on their non-gloved hand between their legs as they crouch behind the plate.
It is typically not as simple as just one finger for a fastball and two for a curve, but not a lot
more complicated than that.
In September 2016, an Astros intern named Derek Vigoa gave a PowerPoint presentation to
general manager Jeff Luhnow that featured an Excel-based application that was programmed
with an algorithm. The algorithm was designed to (and could) decode the pitching signs that
opposing teams’ catchers flashed to their pitchers. The Astros called it “Codebreaker.” One
Astros employee referred to the sign-
stealing system that evolved as the “dark
arts.”1
MLB rules allowed a runner standing on
second base to steal signs and relay them
to the batter, but the MLB rules strictly
forbade using electronic means to
decipher signs. The Astros’ “Codebreaker”
blatantly violated these rules.
According to Wall Street Journal writer Jared Diamond:
The way Codebreaker worked was simple: Somebody would watch an in-game live feed
and log the catcher’s signals into the spreadsheet, as well as the type of pitch that was
actually thrown. With that information, Codebreaker determined how the signs
corresponded with different pitches. Once decided, that information would be
communicated through intermediaries to a baserunner, who would relay them to the
hitter.

Starting around June 2017, the system was embellished by Astros players. They started
watching a live game feed on a monitor near the dugout and then would bang on a trash
can to communicate the coming pitch to the batter. The “banging scheme” lasted
through the 2017 World Series, which the Astros won over the Los Angeles Dodgers.2
This all occurred despite the fact that late in the 2017 season, MLB caught the Boston Red Sox
relaying signs from their video room to an Apple watch worn by a trainer sitting in the dugout.
MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred fined the Red Sox and issued a strong warning to all teams
against illegal electronic sign-stealing.3
However, the Astros’ scheme lasted into the 2018 season in away games as well as home
games, despite the fact that other teams were very suspicious that the Astros were stealing
signs. Other teams often changed their own signs several times a game in an attempt to thwart
the Astros suspected sign stealing. An executive for an opposing team was quoted as saying
“The whole industry knows they’ve been cheating their asses off for three or four years.
Everybody knew it.”4 Indeed, many teams had complained to MLB’s executives about the
Astros’ cheating. Some suspect the cheating continued through the 2019 season although
others think not, and MLB found no convincing evidence of it.5
Sign-stealing might not seem like it would give a big advantage. After all, even if a batter knows
that a certain pitch is coming, he still has to hit it. And it is not easy hitting a 100-mph fastball
or a major league-caliber slider, even if you know it’s coming. Nonetheless, the advantage is
substantial. According to the Washington Nationals’ pitching coach Paul Menhart, “It’s the
worst feeling in the world stepping on that mound and having an idea that the hitter knows
what’s coming. It’s one of the most unnerving feelings. You feel helpless. You just get ticked
off to the point where you lose total focus and confidence.”6 The Washington Nationals won
the 2019 World Series over the favored Astros. They won, at least in part, by assuming that the
Astros would be attempting to steal their signs, and putting into place elaborate
countermeasures, including multiple sets of signs for each pitcher.7
There is no question that many of the Astros players were actively involved in the scheme. The
Astros manager, AJ Hinch, clearly knew about it. There is substantial, though perhaps not
airtight evidence, that General Manager (GM) Rob Luhnhow also knew of the scheme. Carlos
Beltran, a Hall-of-Fame caliber player near the end of his 20-year playing career was a leader in
the scheme. And bench coach Alex Cora was a primary instigator. Owner Jim Crane appears
not to have known of the dark arts being practiced by his club.8
The scandal became public on November 12, 2019, when former Astros’ pitcher Mike Fiers
blew the whistle in an interview published in “The Athletic.”9 Although some current MLB
players praised Fiers for coming forward about the scandal, other players criticized him for
violating baseball’s presumed “code of silence,” also called the “clubhouse code.”10 MLB then
launched an investigation that granted the Astros players immunity in return for their fessing
up. Commissioner Rob Manfred soon issued a nine-page report that found that most of the
Astros players knew of the scheme and many participated in it. The report said that manager
Case Study – The Astros’ Sign Stealing Scandal - Page 2 of 8

Page 3:
Hinch knew of the scheme and that GM Luhnow should have prevented it.11 Commissioner
Manfred suspended both Hinch and Luhnow, who were quickly fired by Astros’ owner Crane.
MLB fined the Astros $5 million, and stripped the club of its first- and second-round draft picks
in both 2020 and 2021.12
There was other fall-out, too. Beltran, who had just been hired as manager of the New York
Mets, was fired. Cora, who had subsequently become the manager of the Boston Red Sox, was
also fired. In late April 2020, Manfred found that the Red Sox had done some illicit sign-stealing
in the 2018 season. Surprisingly, though, he concluded that manager Cora and most of the Red
Sox players did not know about it. Manfred imposed a modest punishment on the Red Sox
organization in the form of a lost draft pick. But again, none of the players who participated in
the scheme were penalized.13
Manfred’s decision not to punish players was harshly criticized by many. He claimed that
granting immunity in exchange for information was the best way to quickly discover the truth.
This approach was praised by some,14 but other observers were unconvinced.15 He also argued
that it was difficult to determine how much advantage the cheating scandal had given the
Astros. However, many major league players – including the game’s best player, Mike Trout –
suggested that they would love to know what pitch was coming.16 Manfred also claimed that
with so many players involved to different degrees, it would be difficult to apportion blame
appropriately. Additionally, MLB had stated in its 2017 warning about sign-stealing that it would
hold management responsible for violations.17
Some suggested that Manfred was simply trying to minimize damage to MLB’s image. The game
got a black eye from the PED scandal, which is brought back into the spotlight every year as
Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, and others are refused entry to the baseball Hall of Fame by
sportswriters who insist on punishing their cheating in ways that MLB never did. And Astros
players such as Carlos Correa, Jose Altuve, and Justin Verlander will probably have a better
chance to enter the Hall of Fame than if they had been suspended for cheating.18
The damage done by the Astros is significant. Former major leaguer Doug Glanville said the
Astros’ “selfish act makes everyone question the validity of the future and the truth of the
past,” concluding that MLB now faces an “existential crisis.”19 Veteran catcher Stephen Vogt
said, “The integrity of our game is what we have, and now that’s been broken.”20
The impact on the Astros and its players, beyond a new manager and general manager, is as yet
unknown. The Astros worry that opposing pitchers will feel some degree of freedom to throw
at Astros hitters. A former major league pitcher, Mike Bolsinger, sued the Astros. He claimed
that a particularly bad outing he had was caused by the Astros’ cheating, and that it effectively
ended his MLB career.21 The effect of their cheating ways can be seen in non-professional
baseball, too, with some little leagues banning the use of “Astros” as a team name.22 Regardless
of league level, gaming the system to advantage one’s own team is not the kind of play that, in
the long run, makes for good sport.

Discussion Questions
1. Why do you think the Astros began using the “Dark Arts”?
[See videos on the self-serving bias (https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/self-serving-
bias) and framing. (https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/framing)]
2. Shortly before the Astros began their sign-stealing scheme, the team’s database was hacked
by Chris Correa, the rival St. Louis Cardinals’ scouting director. He was later sentenced to 46
months in prison.23
a. How might this transgression by Correa have helped motivate the Astros’
decision to cheat?
b. Could it have given the Astros a rationalization for their own cheating? What do
you think that rationalization would be?
[See video on rationalizations.
(https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/rationalizations)]
3. How much responsibility would you place on the players? On the manager? On the general
manager? On the owner? Explain your reasoning.
4. One writer asked: “Given an open road, a sports car and the assurance no law enforcement
would be present, how fast would you drive?”24 He then noted the relative lack of
enforcement by MLB, despite widespread rumors and complaints about the Astros’ (and
perhaps some other clubs’) illegal sign-stealing. Would more surveillance, of the type MLB
used in the 2018 and 2019 playoffs when watchdogs were placed in baseball clubhouses
during the games, have made a difference? Why or why not?
5. Although some MLB players applauded Mike Fiers for coming forward about the scandal,
others criticized him for violating baseball’s supposed “code of silence.”25
a. Is that code common in professions or organizations other than MLB (and the
Mafia)? Support your answer with examples.
b. Is it part of the problem? Why or why not?
c. How might it be reformed or even ended?
[See videos on the conformity bias https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/conformity-
bias https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/conformity-bias and In-group/outgroup.
https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/in-groupout-group]
6. In 2017 “The Athletic” reported that small groups of Astros players expressed misgivings
about the cheating. One player approached Carlos Beltran, who was a ring-leader in the
scheme and a 20-year veteran with a Hall of Fame-caliber career behind him. Beltran
“disregarded [the appeal] and steamrolled everybody.” “Where do you go if you’re a young,
impressionable player with the Astros and this guy says, ‘We’re going to do this.’ What do
Case Study – The Astros’ Sign Stealing Scandal - Page 4 of 8

Page 5:
you do?”26 What does this revelation tell us about obedience to authority? [See videos on
obedience to authority. https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/obedience-to-authority;
https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/obedience-to-authority]
7. On the other hand, Astros shortstop Carlos Correa said: “We didn’t feel scared of Beltran; we
didn’t feel intimidated. He was the nicest guy we could ever have. He was the best
teammate we could ever have. Beltran was obviously a leader of the clubhouse, but we all
had a say in everything we were doing in there.”27 How does this affect your conclusions on
the previous question?
8. In a press conference, Astros’ owner Jim Crane said: “Our players should not be punished for
these actions. These are a great group of guys who did not receive proper guidance from
their leaders.”28 It does appear that GM Luhnhow did know generally of the scheme, that
field manager Hinch definitely knew about it (and did not like it) but did little or nothing to
stop it, and that bench coach Alex Cora and team elder Carlos Beltran were active leaders of
the scheme. Does that absolve the other players? Why or why not?
9. Former Astro J.D. Davis later explained: “I was a rookie, and I was going up and down the
system, and I was fighting for my life. … As a 24-year-old at the time, I was pretty star-struck
at the time being around some of the veteran guys and being around the big-league
clubhouse and everything. I had never been part of a major-league clubhouse. Maybe what
they did was the norm, I have no idea. I had never been in another big-league clubhouse.”29
Does this sound like the conformity bias in action, or just another excuse? Explain your
reasoning.
10. There were clearly Astros players who were uncomfortable with the cheating. Why didn’t
they speak out? What about the Astros players, other than Fiers, who left the club knowing
of the scheme, but never reported it? Why didn’t they speak out?
[See videos on moral muteness https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/moral-muteness
and the Giving Voice to Values video series.
https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/series/giving-voice-to-values]
11. It is perfectly legal to watch the opposing teams’ pitcher and catcher with the naked eye,
even when you’re a runner standing on second base with a primo view of the catchers’
signals. And it’s legal to try to detect those signals and send them to your teammate in the
batter’s box in an attempt to give him an edge. Is the use of electronic means to do the
detecting so close to the traditional means that it doesn’t seem so bad? Explain.
a. How might this line of reasoning be influences by the slippery slope?
[See videos on incrementalism. https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/incrementalism
https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/incrementalism]
12. Why didn’t MLB punish the players who were involved?
Case Study – The Astros’ Sign Stealing Scandal - Page 5 of 8

Page 6:
a. Should the players have been punished as well as the manager and general
manager? Why or why not?
b. Why do you think the managers were allowed to keep their share of the World
Series prize money ($400,000 each)? Is this fair? Why or why not?
13. Did Rob Manfred take a deontological or a utilitarian approach to investigating and
punishing the Astros? Was it the best approach? Explain your reasoning.
[See videos on deontology https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/deontology and
utilitarianism. https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/utilitarianism]
14. In the wake of the scandal, Pete Rose – who is one of the best players in history and was
banned from the game because he gambled on baseball – asked for reinstatement.30 Does
the failure to punish the Astros’ players provide grounds for mercy toward Rose? Why or
why not?
15. Commissioner Manfred refused to strip the Astros of their championship, saying: “Once you
go down that road of changing what happens on the field, I just don’t know how you decide
where you stop.”31 Do you think the Astros should be stripped of their championship?
Explain your reasoning.
