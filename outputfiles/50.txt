Prenatal Diagnosis & Parental Choice
In the United States, many citizens agree that the government may impose limits on the freedom of
individuals when individuals interfere with the rights of others, but the extent of these limits is often a
topic of debate. Among the most debated of bioethical issues is the issue of abortion, which hinges on
whether the fetus is a person with rights, notably the right to life.
In conjunction with the legal right to abortion affirmed in the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade,
the issue of prenatal diagnosis has led to decisions by pregnant women to pursue abortion where
prenatal testing has revealed genetic abnormalities in fetuses. However, this practice has met with
recent opposition in the wake of research showing that between 60 and 90 percent of fetal diagnoses
of Down syndrome have led to abortion. In 2015, legislation was introduced in the Ohio Legislature
that would make it illegal to terminate a pregnancy for the purpose of avoiding giving birth to a baby
with Down syndrome.
Those opposed to this legislation have noted that such a law would violate the Roe v. Wade decision by
the Supreme Court, and that laws based on intention or motivation to terminate would be
unenforceable. “This is interference with a medical decision following a complicated diagnosis,”
according to Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-­‐Choice Ohio, “Not knowing the family
and the circumstances, the legislature can’t possibly take into account all the factors involved.”
Supporters of the legislation have described this as a way to limit the number of abortions in the state
and protect babies born with disabilities. Mike Gonidakis,
president of Ohio Right to Life, stated, “We all want to be born
perfect, but none of us are, and everyone has a right to live,
perfect or not.” Rachel Mullen, a member of the Cuyahoga
County chapter of Ohio Right to Life, said in an interview, “we
need this bill so that [babies with Down syndrome] can be
born, and not culled.”
Teaching Note:
Bioethics examines the moral dimensions surrounding the use of medical technology, raising questions
such as: Should all scientific advances in medicine be made available to all? Do some advances conflict
with society’s values and morals? What role should the government play in the moral decision-­‐making
of individuals insofar and with respect to limiting or expanding choices available? These are broader
questions to keep in mind while reading and discussing this case study.

Discussion Questions:
1. According to those opposing the legislation, what harm is done by limiting women’s freedom to
terminate a pregnancy? According to supporters of the legislation, what is the harm done by
not limiting women’s freedom to terminate a pregnancy?
2. Who are all of the moral agents in this case? Who are the subjects of moral worth? Explain your
reasoning.
3. Since Roe v. Wade holds that first-­‐trimester abortions are legal, is it ethically permissible to
limit the freedom of women who do not wish to bear babies with birth defects if the diagnosis
and the procedure take place in the first trimester? Why or why not?
4. If it is legal to abort babies with disabilities like Down syndrome, what message does this
convey about the value that society places on the lives of persons with disabilities?
5. If the Ohio Legislature decides to criminalize abortion in cases where the motivation for
abortion is a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, does the Legislature have an ethical
responsibility to ensure that poor families are not driven into bankruptcy by the high medical
and educational costs of raising children with disabilities? Why or why not?
6. Should physicians be required to divulge the motivation for terminating a pregnancy? Do you
think this is an ethically defensible reason to breach doctor-­‐patient confidentiality? Explain your
reasoning.
7. Should parents have the freedom to decide whether to abort for other reasons, such as the
discovery that the fetus will be born deaf or diabetic? In a free society, should the government
limit the reproductive options of families who will be left with a financial, emotional, and
physical burden as a result? Explain.
