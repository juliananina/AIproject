Patient Autonomy & Informed Consent
In the context of health care in the United States, the value on autonomy and liberty was cogently
expressed by Justice Benjamin Cardozo in Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospitals (1914), when
he wrote, “Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be
done with his own body.” This case established the principle of informed consent and has become
central to modern medical practice ethics. However, a number of events since 1914 have illustrated
how the autonomy of patients may be overridden. In Buck v. Bell (1927), Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes
wrote that the involuntary sterilization of “mental defectives,” then a widespread practice in the U.S.,
was justified, stating, “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.” Another example, the Tuskegee
Syphilis Study, in which African-­‐American males were denied life-­‐saving treatment for syphilis as part
of a scientific study of the natural course of the disease, began in 1932 and was not stopped until 1972.
Providing advice related to topics of bioethics, the President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical
Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research stated, “Informed consent is rooted in
the fundamental recognition—reflected in the legal presumption of competency—that adults are
entitled to accept or reject health care interventions on the basis of their own personal values and in
furtherance of their own personal goals.” But what of circumstances where patients are deemed
incompetent through judicial proceedings, and where someone else is designated to make decisions on
behalf of a mentally incompetent individual?
Consider the following case:
A middle aged man was involuntarily committed to a state psychiatric hospital because he was
considered dangerous to others due to severe paranoid thinking. His violent behavior was controlled
only by injectable medications, which were initially administered against his will. He had been declared
mentally incompetent, and the decisions to approve the use of psychotropic medications were made
by his adult son who had been awarded guardianship and who held medical power of attorney.
While the medications suppressed the patient’s violent agitation, they made little impact on his
paranoid symptoms. His chances of being able to return to his home community appeared remote.
However, a new drug was introduced into the hospital formulary which, if used with this patient,
offered the strong possibility that he could return home. The drug, however, was only available in a pill
form, and the patient’s paranoia included fears that others would try to poison him. The suggestion
was made to grind up the pill and surreptitiously administer the drug by mixing it in pudding.
Hospital staff checked with the patient’s son and obtained
informed consent from him. The “personal values
and…personal goals” of the son and other family members
were seen to substitute for those of the mentally
incompetent patient—and these goals included the desire
for the patient to live outside of an institution and close to
loved ones in the community. This was the explicitly stated

rationale for the son’s agreeing to the proposal to hide the medication in food. However, staff were
uncomfortable about deceiving the patient, despite having obtained informed consent from the
patient’s guardian.
Discussion Questions:
1. In the case study above, do you think the ends justify the means? In other words, does the goal
of discharging the patient from an institutional setting into normal community living justify
deceiving him? Explain your reasoning.
2. Do you think it is ever ethically permissible to deceive clients? Under what circumstances? Why
or why not?
3. To what degree should family members or legal guardians have full capacity to make decisions
or give consent on behalf of those under their care? Explain.
4. Do you think severely mentally ill people retain any rights “to determine what shall be done
with [their] own [bodies]?” Why or why not?
5. Are there risks in surreptitiously medicating a paranoid patient? Would this confirm the
patient’s delusions of being “poisoned” by others or escalate his resistance to treatment? Are
these risks worth taking in view of the potential to dramatically improve his mental functioning
and reduce his suffering?
6. Since psychiatric patients have the right to treatment, does the strategy to surreptitiously
administer medications serve this goal? Do you think this is ethically justifiable? Why or why
not?
7. Does the history of the forcible treatments of persons with disabilities and other powerless
populations affect how you view this case? Explain
