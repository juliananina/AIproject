The CIA Leak
In 2002, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) asked Joseph Wilson, U.S. diplomat and husband of CIA
agent Valerie Plame, to investigate allegations that Saddam Hussein purchased yellowcake uranium in
Niger. Wilson traveled to Niger and found no evidence of this. Nonetheless, during the 2003 State of
the Union Address, President George W. Bush stated, “The British government has learned that
Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.” On July 6, 2003, Wilson
rebutted this statement in an editorial for The New York Times. One week later, journalist Robert
Novak published an op-ed in The Washington Post criticizing Wilson and releasing information
identifying Plame as a CIA agent. Another journalist, Matthew Cooper, wrote in Time Magazine that
government officials informed him that Wilson’s wife was employed by the CIA. Plame was a classified
covert agent and her actual employment was not public knowledge. Her employer, Brewster Jennings,
was thus unmasked as a CIA front company and their employees worldwide were put at risk.
The CIA asked the Department of Justice to investigate the leak. Bush stated if a leak occurred from his
administration “and if the person violated the law, the person will be taken care of.” He later said, “If
someone committed a crime, they will no longer work in my administration.” A special counsel
examined the legal violations and a grand jury summoned the journalists involved, as well as various
members of the Bush administration, with a focus on presidential aide Karl Rove and Scooter Libby,
Chief of Staff for Vice President Dick Cheney.
Cooper claimed Rove told him Plame’s name and employment, while Rove contended he only learned
of her name from journalists. Evidence suggested Cheney might have informed Libby. Eventually, the
source was revealed as Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State at the time. Armitage was
ultimately not charged because no evidence existed to prove he was aware Plame’s employment was
covert, and thus, illegal to disclose.
The only person charged over the leak was Libby. He was indicted on two counts of perjury, two counts
of making false statements, and one count of obstruction of justice. These charges all stemmed from
testimony he gave during the investigation, not the initial disclosure of information. He resigned from
his position, and was later fined and sentenced to
thirty months in federal prison. President Bush
commuted the prison time, but left the fines intact.
Cheney aggressively sought a full pardon for Libby
and was reportedly very upset with Bush for
refusing to grant it. Bush publicly stated he
respected the jury’s verdict, but Cheney felt Libby
did nothing inappropriate.

Wilson and Plame eventually filed a civil lawsuit against Rove, Libby, Cheney, and Armitage for their
role in disclosing her identity. The lawsuit was dismissed, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear
the dismissal on appeal.
In 2018, President Donald Trump pardoned Libby, stating, “I don’t know Mr. Libby, but for years I have
heard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion
of his life.” Cheney responded to the pardon, stating, “He is innocent, and he and his family have
suffered for years because of his wrongful conviction. I am grateful today that President Trump righted
this wrong.”
Plame saw the pardon as a dangerous precedent that could further endanger the safety of covert
operatives and the operations of the CIA. In an op-ed, Plame wrote, “The pardon power of the
president cannot be challenged constitutionally; it should be wielded with enormous diligence and
prudence. In granting his pardon to Scooter Libby, Donald Trump seems to have avoided the careful
process of review within the Justice Department that has been established to consider pardons,”
continuing, “Our national security is at serious risk when there is daylight and distrust between the
president and the CIA.”
Discussion Questions
1. Which person involved in this complex case do you think was most subject to bounded
ethicality? Why?
2. How do the situational factors of this case pose challenges for those involved to act ethically?
3. How were the actions of Bush, Cheney, and Libby subject to bounded ethicality? In this case,
what organizational pressures or psychological factors may have influenced each of their
decisions? Explain.
4. President Bush was caught between the interests of Cheney, Rove, and Libby on the one hand,
and Plame, Wilson, and the CIA on the other. Do you think President Bush’s actions were
ethically ideal? Why or why not?
5. If you were in President Bush’s position, how would you have handled this situation? Explain
how your resolution would minimize harm to those involved.
6. Do you think it was ethically permissible to pardon Libby? Why or why not?
7. Does Libby’s pardoning, as Plame suggested, cause further harm? If so, to whom or what?
Explain.
