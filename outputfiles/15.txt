Cheating: Sign-Stealing in the MLB
In baseball, catchers signal to pitchers which type of pitch to throw. Usually, catchers do this by holding
down a certain number of fingers on their non-gloved hand between their legs as they crouch behind
the plate. It is typically not as simple as just one finger for a fastball and two for a curve, but not a lot
more complicated than that.
In September 2016, an intern for the Houston Astros major league baseball (MLB) team named Derek
Vigoa showed Astros’ general manager Jeff Luhnow a PowerPoint presentation. It featured an Excel-
based application programmed with an algorithm that could decode the pitching signs that opposing
teams’ catchers flashed to their pitchers. The Astros called it “Codebreaker.” One organization
employee referred to the sign-stealing system that evolved as the “dark arts.”
MLB rules allowed a runner standing on second base to do what he could to steal signs and relay them
to the batter. But MLB rules strictly forbade using electronic means to decipher and signal signs. The
Astros “Codebreaker” violated these rules.
According to Wall Street Journal writer Jared Diamond:
The way Codebreaker worked was simple: Somebody would watch an in-game live feed and log
the catcher’s signals into the spreadsheet, as well as the type of pitch that was actually
thrown. With that information, Codebreaker determined how the signs corresponded with
different pitches. Once decided, that information would be communicated through
intermediaries to a baserunner, who would relay them to the hitter.
Starting around June 2017, the system was embellished by Astros players. They started
watching a live game feed on a monitor near the dugout and then would bang on a trash can to
communicate the coming pitch to the batter. The “banging scheme” lasted through the 2017
World Series, which the Astros won over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Late in the 2017 season, MLB caught the Boston Red Sox relaying signs from their video room to an
Apple watch worn by a trainer sitting in the dugout. Commissioner Rob Manfred fined the Red Sox and
issued a strong warning to all teams against illegal electronic sign-stealing. It was suspected
(accurately, as it turns out) that the New York Yankees had also been using technology to steal signs in
2015 and 2016. Despite these incidences, and the MLB warning, the Astros continue with
“Codebreaker.”
The Astros’ scheme lasted into the 2018 season, in
road games as well as home games, even though other
teams were very suspicious that the Astros were
stealing signs. Other teams often changed their own
signs several times a game in an attempt to thwart the
suspected sign stealing by the Astros. An executive for
an opposing team was quoted as saying “The whole

industry knows they’ve been cheating their asses off for three or four years. Everybody knew it.”
(Svrluga & Sheinin). Indeed, many teams had complained to MLB’s executives about the Astros’
cheating. Some suspect the cheating continued through the 2019 season, though others think not.
For the uninitiated, sign-stealing might not seem like it would give a big advantage. After all, even if a
batter knows that a certain pitch is coming, he still has to hit it. It can’t be easy hitting a 100-mph
fastball or a major league-caliber slider, even if you know it’s coming. Nonetheless, the advantage is
substantial. According to the Washington Nationals’ pitching coach Paul Menhart, “It’s the worst
feeling in the world stepping on that mound and having an idea that the hitter knows what’s
coming. It’s one of the most unnerving feelings. You feel helpless. You just get ticked off to the point
where you lose total focus and confidence.” (Svrluga & Sheinin).
There is no question that many of the Astros players were actively involved in the scheme. The Astros
manager, AJ Hinch, clearly knew about it. There is substantial, though perhaps not airtight evidence,
that General Manager Rob Luhnhow also knew. Carlos Beltran, a Hall-of-Fame caliber player near the
end of his 20-year playing career, was a leader in the scheme. Bench coach Alex Cora was a primary
instigator. Owner Jim Crane appears not to have known of the dark arts being practiced by his club.
The scandal became public on November 12, 2019, when former Astros’ pitcher Mike Fiers blew the
whistle in an interview published in “The Athletic” (Rosenthal & Drellich). MLB then launched an
investigation that granted the Astros players immunity in return for their fessing up. Commissioner Rob
Manfred soon issued a nine-page report that found that most of the Astros players knew of the
scheme and many participated in it. The report also found that manager Hinch knew of the scheme
and that GM Luhnow should have prevented it. Manfred suspended both Hinch and Luhnow, who
were quickly fired by Astros’ owner Crane. MLB fined the Astros $5 million and stripped the club of its
first- and second-round draft picks in both 2020 and 2021. Cora and Beltran lost managing jobs they
had acquired.
The damage done by the Astros is significant. As veteran catcher Stephen Vogt said, “The integrity of
our game is what we have, and now that’s been broken.” Former major-leaguer Doug Glanville
concluded that MLB now faces an “existential crisis” saying that the Astros’ “selfish act makes
everyone question the validity of the future and the truth of the past.”

Discussion Questions
1. How might the fact that two of MLB’s best teams had been caught illegally sign stealing (Red
Sox) or suspected of it (Yankees) affected the Astros? Is “if everyone is doing it, it must be okay”
a rationalization that is consistent with the conformity bias? Explain.
2. Former Astro J.D. Davis later explained: “I was a rookie, and I was going up and down the
system, and I was fighting for my life. … As a 24-year-old at the time, I was pretty star-struck at
the time being around some of the veteran guys and being around the big-league clubhouse
and everything. I had never been part of a major-league clubhouse. Maybe what they did was
the norm, I have no idea. I had never been in another big-league clubhouse.” Does this sound
like the conformity bias in action, or just another rationalization? What do you think and why?
3. If J.D. Davis in the previous question had been a seasoned veteran, would it have been easier
for him to “just say no” to the scheme? Explain.
1. Would it have been easy? Why or why not?
4. Although some MLB players lauded Mike Fiers for coming forward about the scandal, others
criticized him for allegedly violating baseball’s “code of silence” (also called the “clubhouse
code.”) Is that code common in professions or organizations other than MLB (and the Mafia)?
1. Is it part of the problem? Why or why not?
2. Is it a manifestation of the conformity bias? If so, how?
3. How might this code be reformed or even ended?There were clearly Astros players who
were uncomfortable with the cheating. Why didn’t they speak out? What about the
Astros players, other than Fiers, who left the club knowing of the scheme, but never
reported it? Why didn’t they speak out?
5. There were clearly Astros players who were uncomfortable with the cheating. Why didn’t they
speak out? What about the Astros players, other than Fiers, who left the club knowing of the
scheme, but never reported it? Why didn’t they speak out?
6. It has been widely reported that former President Trump is a notorious cheater when he plays
golf. As reported in Rick Reilly’s book:
“I played with him once,’ says Bryan Marsal, longtime Wingfoot member and chair of the
coming 2020 Men’s U.S. Open. ‘It was a Saturday morning game. We go to the first tee and he
couldn’t have been nicer. But then he said: ‘You see those two guys? They cheat. See me? I
cheat. And I expect you to cheat because we’re going to beat those two guys today.’ So, yes, it’s
true, he’s going to cheat you. But I think Donald, in his heart of hearts, believes that you’re
gonna cheat him, too. So if it’s the same, if everybody’s cheating, he doesn’t see it as really
cheating.

1. Does this sound like the conformity bias in action? Explain.
2. Does it sound like the collective illusion concept, which describes how people in a group
go along with an idea that they don’t agree with simply because they believe
(incorrectly) that most people in the group agree with that idea? Explain.
7. As the Obedience to Authority video in this series explains, people’s tendency to want to please
people in a position of authority also played a role in the Astros’ sign-stealing behavior.
Describe how.
8. What other behavioral concepts studied in this series might also have played a role? For
example, did the self-serving bias play a role? Explain. How about framing? Explain.
