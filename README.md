## Script Execution Order

The scripts should be run in the following order:

1. `v2.py`
2. `noCaseStudyPDFScanner.py`
3. `pdfReader.py`

NOTE: pdfReader.py requires a chat GPT API auth token to enable access. We did not include our personal key because of privacy concerns.

### Notes
- `nodownloadbutton.txt` contains the case studies that do not have a downloadable PDF.
