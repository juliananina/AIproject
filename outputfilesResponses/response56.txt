1. Are you surprised to learn that some of these inspiring Paralympians are cheating? Why or why not?
   - It can be surprising to learn that Paralympians are cheating given the common perception of these athletes as inspirational figures overcoming great challenges. However, considering the competitive nature of sports and the various pressures involved, it may not be entirely unexpected that some individuals succumb to the temptation to cheat to gain an advantage.

2. Why do you think some Paralympians cheat?
   - Paralympians may cheat for various reasons, including the desire for fame, recognition, financial rewards, pressure to succeed, fear of failure, or even misguided beliefs that cheating is justifiable considering the competitive environment. Some athletes may also cheat due to a lack of oversight or enforcement of rules within the system.

3. What psychological biases, social pressures, or rationalizations might these athletes employ to support their decision to cheat? Explain.
   - Athletes may use rationalizations such as minimizing the harm caused by cheating, blaming others, or justifying their behavior by convincing themselves that everyone else is doing it. Social pressures from peers, coaches, or the desire to meet expectations can also influence athletes to cheat. Psychological biases like overconfidence in their abilities or a desire to maintain a positive self-image may further contribute to their decision to cheat.

4. Why do we seem to have cheating in the Paralympics, but not the Special Olympics?
   a. Can the video on “incentive gaming” shed some light on this question?
   - Cheating in the Paralympics may be more prevalent due to factors like higher stakes, greater visibility, and a more competitive environment compared to the Special Olympics. The incentive gaming video may provide insights into how external rewards and pressures can influence individuals to cheat in pursuit of success and recognition.
