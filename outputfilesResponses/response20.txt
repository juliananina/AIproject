Analysis of the Case Study:

1. Overconfidence Bias:
a. The overconfidence bias could partially explain why individuals like Briles, Starr, and McCaw made poor decisions despite being perceived as good Christian men. Their confidence in their own character and religiosity might have led them to believe they were above reproach and immune to moral lapses. This overconfidence could have clouded their judgment and prevented them from critically evaluating their actions in the Baylor scandal.

2. Gap between Perception and Reality:
a. Evidence in the Baylor situation suggests a significant gap between how ethical the individuals involved thought they were and their actual ethical behavior. Despite believing in their moral righteousness, their actions showed disregard for the safety and well-being of others, particularly female students on campus.
b. In personal life, instances of overestimating one's ethicality can occur when individuals fail to recognize their own biases or rationalizations. Reflecting on past decisions may reveal discrepancies between perceived moral character and actual conduct.

3. Ethical Fading:
a. Ethical fading, where moral considerations diminish in importance due to a focus on other goals, likely played a role in the Baylor scandal. The pursuit of football success and associated benefits overshadowed the ethical responsibilities towards victims of assault and Title IX obligations.
b. By prioritizing athletic achievements over ethical standards, individuals like Briles, Starr, and McCaw allowed moral considerations to fade into the background, leading to negligent decision-making.

4. Conflicts of Interest:
a. Conflicts of interest can compromise ethical decision-making, as seen in the Baylor case where the desire for football success conflicted with ensuring the safety of female students. The prioritization of sports achievements over addressing misconduct created a situation where the welfare of victims was disregarded.
b. Conflicts of interest may have influenced the choices made by Briles, Starr, and McCaw, as their commitment to football excellence distracted them from upholding ethical standards and fulfilling their duty to protect students.

5. Moral Licensing:
a. Moral licensing might have influenced the behavior of individuals involved in the Baylor scandal, where past successes and values of Christian faith were used to justify overlooking transgressions. The perception of being morally upright could have provided a false sense of entitlement to act against ethical standards in specific situations.
b. Reflecting on personal experiences, individuals may recognize instances of moral licensing where past good deeds led to leniency in subsequent actions, compromising ethical decision-making.

6. Altruistic Cheating:
a. The concept of altruistic cheating, where individuals justify wrongdoing as helping others, could explain the leniency shown towards football players involved in misconduct at Baylor. By framing their actions as assisting troubled individuals, Briles and others may have rationalized their decisions to overlook misconduct.
b. Altruistic cheating may have played a role in the scandal at Baylor, as individuals justified their actions by believing they were providing support and opportunities for redemption to athletes, disregarding the impact on victims and ethical responsibilities.

Overall, the Baylor case study highlights the importance of self-awareness, transparency, and ethical accountability in leadership roles, especially when faced with conflicts of interest and moral dilemmas. It underscores the need for individuals to critically assess their decision-making processes and consider the impact of their actions on others, even when pursuing personal or organizational goals.
