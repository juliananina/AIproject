1. Do you believe that flying a Confederate flag is ethically prohibited? Why or why not?
- The ethics of flying a Confederate flag are subjective and depend on individual perspectives. Some may argue that the flag represents a painful history of racism and should not be displayed, while others may view it as a symbol of heritage and pride. It is important to consider the context and the impact such displays may have on different communities.

2. In what ways is displaying a Confederate flag similar or different to displaying other types of flags such as a tribal flag, a national flag, a corporate flag, a sports team flag, or a rainbow flag?
- Displaying a Confederate flag can be similar to displaying other flags in terms of representing identity, history, and belonging to a particular group. However, the Confederate flag has a unique history tied to the Civil War and the legacy of racism. Tribal flags, national flags, corporate flags, sports team flags, and rainbow flags may also carry specific meanings and symbolism related to their respective groups.

3. Should retailers bow to public pressure to discontinue sales of controversial items even if they are not illegal, such as toy guns, fur coats, or Native American headdresses?
- Retailers have the discretion to decide which products to sell based on public demand and ethical considerations. If public pressure indicates that certain items are offensive or perpetuate harmful stereotypes, retailers may choose to discontinue selling them to align with societal values and avoid controversy.

4. Is it possible to make an objective decision in the case of the Confederate flag? How might you come to a decision that is both reasonable and defensible?
- Making an objective decision regarding the Confederate flag can be challenging due to its complex historical and cultural significance. One approach to reaching a reasonable and defensible decision could involve considering different perspectives, conducting thorough research on the flag's history, and evaluating the potential impact of its display on various communities.

5. Can you think of an example of another situation in which there were two views that were strongly opposed to each other? How was the situation resolved? Do you think the ethically ideal decision was reached? Why or why not?
- An example of a situation with two strongly opposed views could be the debate over same-sex marriage. This issue was resolved in the United States through legal battles and public opinion shifts leading to the legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide. The ethically ideal decision is subjective and may vary depending on personal beliefs and values. It is important to consider the outcomes and implications of the decision on individuals and society as a whole.
