Discussion Questions:

1. It seems that Chris Correa did have a framing problem in the sense that he did not consider the ethical or legal ramifications of his actions when he launched his hacking scheme. His justification that it was all part of a "game" and a form of retaliation against another team indicates a skewed perspective on the seriousness of his actions. Framing problems can occur when individuals fail to see the broader context and implications of their choices and focus only on immediate motivations or justifications.

2. Engaging in competition at the highest levels of baseball does not provide sufficient justification for violating moral standards or the law. While competition can be intense and emotions high in such environments, it is essential to maintain integrity and respect for ethical boundaries. Winning in sports or any other field should not come at the cost of compromising one's values or engaging in criminal activities.

3. The analogy of breaking into someone's house to recover stolen belongings does not morally or legally justify the act. Vigilante justice or taking matters into one's own hands is not an acceptable way to address perceived wrongs. In the case of Chris Correa, the judge rightly did not condone his actions, emphasizing that seeking justice must be done through appropriate channels and within the boundaries of the law.

4. The self-serving bias could indeed play a role in influencing individuals to downplay ethics when making decisions, especially if they believe their actions will benefit them personally. This bias might lead people to prioritize their own interests over moral considerations and rationalize unethical behavior. Understanding and acknowledging the presence of biases is essential to making sound ethical decisions.

5. Recognizing the impact of one's actions on others is crucial in determining the presence of a framing problem. If someone is unaware or indifferent to how their behavior affects others, it may indicate a lack of empathy or consideration for ethical boundaries. Chris Correa's realization of the disrespect he showed to those whose privacy he violated highlights the importance of empathy and understanding the consequences of one's actions.

6. Leo Durocher's statement that "Winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing" reflects a controversial perspective in the world of sports. While winning is undoubtedly important, achieving success with honor and integrity should be the ultimate goal. Engaging in unethical or illegal activities to secure victories tarnishes the spirit of competition and diminishes the achievements. Honoring the principles of fair play and sportsmanship is essential for maintaining the integrity of sports and upholding moral standards.

In conclusion, the case study of Cardinal's Computer Hacking raises important questions about ethics, framing problems, and the consequences of unethical behavior in professional sports. It serves as a reminder of the significance of upholding moral standards and ethical values even in highly competitive environments.
