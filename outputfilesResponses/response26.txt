1. The ethical requirement for the United States to respond to epidemics and health crises in foreign countries can be debated. Some may argue that as a leading global power and a country with significant resources, the U.S. has a moral obligation to assist in times of crisis regardless of borders. Others may argue that while humanitarian aid is important, prioritizing domestic health needs should take precedence over foreign interventions.

2. Concentrating relief efforts along historical colonial lines during the Ebola outbreak raises questions about the motives behind such decisions. While former colonial powers may feel a certain responsibility towards their former colonies, the distribution of aid should be based on need and effectiveness rather than historical ties. Imperialist nations may have a responsibility to aid their former colonies due to the legacy of exploitation and resource extraction, but this aid should be provided in a way that empowers local communities and respects their autonomy.

3. Deploying the U.S. military in humanitarian relief efforts can have both benefits and potential harms. The military's logistical capabilities and resources can provide quick and effective response in crisis situations. However, there is a risk of militarizing humanitarian aid, which may undermine the principles of neutrality and impartiality that are crucial in relief efforts. Careful consideration should be given to the specific context and needs of each situation before deciding to involve the military in humanitarian efforts.

4. Evaluating President Obama's response to the Ebola epidemic depends on various factors. Some may argue that his initial caution in responding to the crisis may have delayed effective intervention, while others may appreciate the scale and scope of the eventual military intervention. If in his position, one might have prioritized earlier and more targeted interventions to prevent the rapid spread of the virus. The judgment of his response should consider the outcomes achieved in relation to the resources invested.

5. The outcome of many treatment facilities built by the American military remaining unused to treat Ebola patients raises questions about the effectiveness and efficiency of the relief effort. This outcome may lead to a reevaluation of the decision to involve the military in such a capacity and the allocation of resources towards more impactful interventions. President Obama's response may be judged in part by the utilization and impact of the resources deployed, as seen in the case of the unutilized treatment centers.
