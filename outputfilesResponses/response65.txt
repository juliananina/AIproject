1. Wong critiqued the production of Miss Saigon because he believed that "yellow-face" performance, which involves casting non-Asians in roles written for Asians, perpetuates stereotypes and limits opportunities for Asian actors. The harm caused by "yellow-face" performance is the reinforcement of cultural stereotypes, the erasure of authentic representation, and the marginalization of Asian actors and communities.

2. Frank Rich argued that not allowing Pryce to perform would harm the artistic quality of the production. He believed that Pryce's performance was integral to the success of the musical and that prioritizing racial authenticity over talent would compromise the artistic vision of the show. Rich justified his argument by emphasizing the importance of showcasing the best talent, regardless of race.

3. The continued occurrence of white actors representing Asians in theatre and film may be attributed to a combination of factors, including historical norms, limited opportunities for Asian actors, unconscious biases in casting decisions, and the perpetuation of racial stereotypes for dramatic effect. There may also be a lack of awareness or sensitivity towards the impact of such casting choices.

4. It can be more problematic for a white actor to portray a person of color than for an actor of color to perform a role written for a white person because of the historical context of racial discrimination, power dynamics, and representation. White actors playing characters of color can reinforce stereotypes, cultural appropriation, and marginalization, which contribute to systemic inequalities.

5. The history of racial and ethnic discrimination in the United States factors into the debate by highlighting the legacy of racism, stereotypes, and unequal representation in the entertainment industry. This history influences perceptions of race, casting decisions, and the power dynamics that shape controversial issues like "yellow-face" performance.

6. The scarcity of opportunities and representations for minority groups can lead to underrepresentation, misrepresentation, and stereotyping in media and entertainment. This scarcity reinforces systemic inequalities, affects public perceptions, and limits the visibility and recognition of diverse voices and experiences.

7. Producers and casting directors can appropriately represent characters on stage and screen by prioritizing diversity, inclusivity, and authenticity in their casting choices. They should consider the cultural context of the narrative, engage in open dialogues with the community, and actively seek out talent from underrepresented groups. Purposefully being more inclusive in casting can help challenge stereotypes, promote representation, and create a more equitable and diverse entertainment landscape.

I hope this analysis helps you understand the key points of the case study and provides insights into the discussion questions.
