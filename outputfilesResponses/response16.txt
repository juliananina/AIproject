**Discussion Questions:**

1. **Incrementalism in Academic Fraud at UNC:**
   - Incrementalism was involved in the case of academic fraud at UNC as the fraudulent activities started small with one or two student-athletes taking advantage of "paper" courses to maintain eligibility. Over time, this practice grew and became systematic, involving faculty, staff, student-athletes, and non-athletes. The gradual acceptance and normalization of these fraudulent practices led to an entrenched culture of academic dishonesty at UNC.

2. **Involvement of Faculty, Staff, and Students in Academic Fraud:**
   - Faculty and staff may have knowingly taught or encouraged students to take the "paper" courses due to various reasons such as pressure to maintain student-athlete eligibility, close relationships with the athletic department, or personal gain. Students might have taken these classes to bypass rigorous academic requirements and focus more on their sports. The existence of these courses provided an easy way for student-athletes with poor academic performance to remain eligible to play sports.

3. **Slippery Slope of Academic Fraud:**
   - Making exceptions for a few student-athletes to take advantage of fraudulent courses opened the door to a slippery slope of academic fraud. Once the system was established, it became increasingly difficult to deny similar opportunities to other student-athletes who required academic assistance. The desire to maintain a competitive athletic program and avoid scrutiny likely contributed to the expansion of fraudulent practices.

4. **Responsibilities of Universities to Student Athletes:**
   - Major universities have a responsibility to ensure that student-athletes receive a quality education while participating in athletics. Balancing academic and athletic success requires institutions to prioritize genuine learning opportunities for student-athletes and provide adequate support to help them excel both academically and athletically. Universities should establish clear guidelines and monitor academic integrity to prevent situations like the one at UNC.

5. **Preventing Academic Fraud and Supporting Success:**
   - Universities can support both academic and athletic success by implementing stringent academic standards for student-athletes, promoting a culture of integrity, providing academic support services, and fostering a balanced approach to student development. Transparency, accountability, and ethical decision-making are essential in ensuring that student-athletes receive a meaningful education and have the opportunity to excel in their chosen sports.
