Discussion Questions:

1. The benefits and harms of piracy in the music industry have been a topic of debate for many years. Some artists argue that piracy can lead to exposure and access for listeners, potentially increasing their fan base and concert attendance. However, piracy also causes financial harm to artists and producers who rely on sales for income. Whether the benefits outweigh the harms is subjective and depends on individual perspectives. It is important to consider the ethical implications of accessing copyrighted material without compensating the creators.

2. The positive outcome of stimulating payment-based services due to Napster's activities does not necessarily justify its illegal actions. While Napster's innovations may have indirectly led to the creation of legal and paid distribution platforms such as iTunes and Pandora, it is essential to uphold copyright laws and respect intellectual property rights. Unauthorized file-sharing undermines the efforts of artists, producers, and rights holders to earn a living from their creative work.

3. If Apple had not agreed to compensate artists in response to Taylor Swift's open letter, it could have raised ethical concerns for consumers considering subscribing to their service. Supporting a company that does not fairly compensate artists for their work may be viewed as contributing to the exploitation of creative talent. Apple's response to Swift's concerns demonstrated a willingness to address ethical considerations and support artists, which could influence consumer decisions to subscribe to their service.

4. In cases of piracy, various moral rules may be violated, such as the rule against theft or deception. Piracy not only affects artists and producers but also impacts music labels, distributors, and other stakeholders in the industry. Additionally, the broader implications of piracy extend to the devaluation of creative work, hindering investment in new talent, and undermining the sustainability of the music industry. Considering the wider implications of piracy may prompt individuals to reflect on the ethical considerations and potential harms caused by engaging in or supporting unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material.
