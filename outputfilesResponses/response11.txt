Discussion Questions:
1. Beyond green consumption, what other types of products might bring about similar kinds of moral licensing effects? Can you think of instances in your own life when your purchase choices have licensed you to make decisions that were less than ethically ideal? Explain.

Answer: Products that are associated with health or socially responsible attributes may also lead to moral licensing effects. For example, purchasing a gym membership might lead someone to justify indulging in unhealthy food choices. In my own life, buying fair trade products has sometimes made me feel like I can justify other less ethical choices, such as buying non-environmentally friendly items. This phenomenon is important to consider in order to make more conscious and consistent ethical decisions.

2. Do you think these moral licensing effects are common across all kinds of green consumers? Or are there other factors (i.e. demographics, psychographics) that might either exacerbate or weaken the effects? Why or why not?

Answer: These moral licensing effects may vary among green consumers based on factors such as demographics, psychographics, personal values, and level of environmental concern. For instance, individuals who are highly committed to environmental causes may be less likely to experience moral licensing effects compared to those who engage in green behaviors more superficially. Factors like income level, age, and cultural background could also influence the likelihood of moral licensing effects.

3. The authors of the study, Mazar and Zhong, initially thought green consumption would have a positive spillover effect and encourage positive behaviors. Why do you think they found the opposite?

Answer: It is possible that the initial assumption of a positive spillover effect from green consumption was based on idealistic expectations rather than empirical evidence. The unexpected findings could be attributed to the complex nature of human behavior, where individuals may subconsciously rationalize their ethical actions by subsequently engaging in less ethical behaviors. The contrast between conscious intentions and actual behaviors could have led to the discovery of moral licensing effects.

4. What steps do you think can be taken to help minimize or mitigate these types of moral licensing effects among green consumers? Explain.

Answer: To reduce moral licensing effects among green consumers, education and awareness campaigns could be implemented to highlight the importance of consistent ethical decision-making. Brands and marketers can also promote a holistic understanding of sustainability and ethical consumption, emphasizing the interconnectedness of various choices. Encouraging reflection on personal values and ethical motivations behind purchasing behaviors may help individuals stay true to their ethical commitments.

5. If you were the brand manager for a green product, for example an organic food item or an energy-efficient appliance, how would you go about marketing the product knowing these licensing effects were possible?

Answer: As a brand manager for a green product, I would focus on promoting a comprehensive sustainability narrative that goes beyond the product itself. Emphasizing the overall mission and values of the brand, along with providing transparent information about the sourcing and production processes, can help build trust and credibility among consumers. Encouraging a mindset of holistic ethical consumption rather than isolated green purchases could also help mitigate moral licensing effects. Additionally, offering guidance on making consistent ethical choices in daily life could further support consumers in aligning their behaviors with their values.
