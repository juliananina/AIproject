Discussion Questions:

1. It is fair to criticize Paterno, Spanier, Schultz, and Curley for prioritizing the protection of the Penn State brand over the safety and well-being of children in the Sandusky scandal. As leaders in the university, they had a responsibility to report and address the allegations of child sexual abuse promptly and effectively, regardless of the potential impact on the institution's reputation. Their failure to take appropriate action allowed Sandusky to continue his abusive behavior, illustrating a clear lapse in moral judgment and ethical responsibility.

2. The bias between the tangible harm to the university's brand and the abstract nature of the victims' suffering likely influenced the decisions made by Paterno, Spanier, Schultz, and Curley. Their long-standing connections to Penn State and deep investment in its success may have led them to prioritize protecting the university's image over addressing the concrete harm inflicted upon the victims. This bias may have clouded their judgment and prevented them from fully recognizing the severity of the situation and the urgent need to protect vulnerable children.

3. The rationalizations and justifications presented in question 3 reflect a mindset that potentially enabled the four men to distance themselves from the true impact of Sandusky's actions. By dehumanizing the victims and minimizing the repercussions of inaction, they may have absolved themselves of the moral responsibility to intervene and prevent further harm. This cognitive dissonance allowed them to compartmentalize the issue and avoid confronting the full extent of the harm caused by Sandusky's abuse.

4. The concept of white-collar crime occurring more frequently when there is no personal contact with the victims aligns with the Sandusky scandal. The lack of direct interaction with the victims may have contributed to the men's ability to rationalize their inaction and ignore the gravity of the situation. By dissociating themselves from the actual impact of the abuse on the victims, they may have diminished their sense of accountability and responsibility, enabling them to maintain their perceived legitimacy and righteousness.

5. Other behavioral ethics concepts that may have played a role in this case include the self-serving bias and role morality. The self-serving bias could have influenced the men's decision-making by shaping their interpretations of the situation in a way that minimized personal accountability and preserved their self-image as ethical individuals. Role morality might have led them to prioritize their roles within the university over their moral obligations to protect vulnerable individuals, contributing to their ethical lapses and failure to take decisive action.

In conclusion, the Sandusky scandal highlights the complexities of ethical decision-making in the face of competing interests and biases. The failure of Paterno, Spanier, Schultz, and Curley to act decisively in response to allegations of child sexual abuse raises important questions about the impact of institutional loyalty, cognitive biases, and ethical lapses in high-profile cases of wrongdoing.
