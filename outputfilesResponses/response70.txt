Discussion Questions:

1. What moral emotions seem to have been at play in this case? On the part of the bank’s employees? The bank’s victims? The bank’s regulators? The bank’s shareholders?
- Bank’s employees: Guilt, embarrassment, stress, panic, fear of retaliation, discomfort, and unsettlement.
- Bank’s victims: Betrayal, anger, frustration, mistrust, and financial loss.
- Bank’s regulators: Outrage, disappointment, skepticism, and demand for accountability.
- Bank’s shareholders: Anger, disappointment, concern over financial losses and reputation damage.

2. What factors contributed particularly to the outrage and anger that legislators, regulators, customers, and shareholders felt?
- Deception and fraud committed against customers without their consent.
- The magnitude of the wrongdoing, including millions of fake accounts and various other unethical practices.
- Lack of accountability and attempts to cover up the fraudulent activities.
- Targeting vulnerable groups like the elderly and minorities.
- Repeated instances of overcharging and mistreatment of customers.

3. Clearly inner-directed emotions such as guilt and embarrassment affected the actions of Wells Fargo employees. Were they always sufficient to overcome the employees’ utilitarian calculation: “I need this job”?
- While guilt and embarrassment may have influenced some employees to speak out or resist unethical practices, the fear of losing their jobs due to the pressure to meet unrealistic sales targets likely played a significant role.
- Utilitarian calculations based on job security and financial stability could have overshadowed moral emotions in many cases, leading employees to engage in fraudulent behavior.

4. Did moral emotions motivate some of the whistleblowers? How?
- Yes, moral emotions such as guilt, discomfort, and a sense of responsibility likely motivated some whistleblowers to speak out against the fraudulent practices at Wells Fargo.
- The whistleblowers may have been driven by a desire to do the right thing, expose wrongdoing, and protect customers from harm even at personal risk.

5. In the wake of everything described in the case study, Wells Fargo has made significant changes. Do you think these changes were made out of a utilitarian calculation designed to avoid further monetary penalties, a desire to avoid shame and embarrassment, or both? If a combination, which do you think played a bigger role? Why?
- The changes made by Wells Fargo, such as firing employees, clawing back bonuses, and dismantling sales incentives, appear to be driven by a combination of utilitarian considerations and a desire to address public outrage and restore trust.
- The need to avoid further financial penalties and regulatory sanctions likely played a significant role, but the desire to mitigate the shame and embarrassment caused by the scandal and salvage the bank's reputation also influenced the decisions.
- Ultimately, the need to avoid further reputational damage and financial losses may have played a bigger role in driving the changes, as the long-term viability of the bank was at stake.
