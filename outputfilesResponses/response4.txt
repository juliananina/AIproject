1. Roosevelt believed in a more expansive view of the presidency, seeing it as his duty to do anything necessary for the nation unless expressly forbidden by the Constitution or laws. On the other hand, Taft adhered to a more strict constructionist model, where the president's powers were limited to what was explicitly granted by the Constitution or Congress.

2. Roosevelt tended to blur the line between law and ethics by taking actions he felt were right, even if they stretched the limits of his executive powers. Taft, on the other hand, made decisions based on evidence and legal justifications, ensuring his actions were within the boundaries of the law.

3. Roosevelt's approach suggests a form of overconfidence bias, as he often acted based on what he believed to be right without always considering the legal limitations. Taft, with his more cautious and legalistic approach, demonstrated less overconfidence bias in his decision-making.

4. In the case of U.S. Steel, Taft's actions in violating the informal agreement caused more harm as it disrupted the understanding formed by Roosevelt with the company. This violation led to tensions and ultimately to the break in their relationship.

5. Considering both legal and ethical considerations, Taft's approach to the presidency may be preferable as it respects the constraints of the law and seeks decisions based on established norms and evidence.

6. An example of a world leader with an approach similar to Taft could be Angela Merkel, the former Chancellor of Germany, known for her methodical decision-making and adherence to legal frameworks. This approach has influenced her political actions, leading to a reputation for stability and respect for institutional norms.

Overall, the contrasting approaches of Roosevelt and Taft shed light on differing philosophies of presidential power, ethics, and decision-making, highlighting the complexities of leadership in navigating the balance between legal constraints and ethical responsibilities.
