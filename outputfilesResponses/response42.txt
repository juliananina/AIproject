1) Rush Limbaugh's fundamental attribution error in this case can be described as attributing drug addiction purely to individual choice rather than acknowledging any potential underlying factors such as mental health issues, chronic pain, or genetic predispositions. He seems to oversimplify the complex nature of addiction by emphasizing personal responsibility and ignoring external influences.

2) Limbaugh's own experience with drug addiction may or may not change his opinion on drug abuse. It could lead to greater empathy and understanding towards individuals struggling with addiction, leading him to advocate for more compassionate and supportive approaches to addressing substance abuse. However, it is also possible that he may continue to uphold his original perspective and view his addiction as an isolated incident rather than recognizing the broader societal issues at play.

3) If a person were a regular listener of Limbaugh's talk show, the disclosure of his drug addiction could significantly impact their opinion of him. It may lead to feelings of betrayal or hypocrisy if they had previously admired his strong stance against drug use. On the other hand, if someone was not a regular listener, they might view Limbaugh's situation with more detachment and see it as a personal struggle rather than a reflection of his overall character.

4) An example of the fundamental attribution error in popular media could be the portrayal of individuals with mental health issues as simply lacking willpower or being morally weak. This oversimplification fails to consider the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that contribute to mental health disorders.

5) An example of the fundamental attribution error from one's own life could be automatically assuming that a coworker who is often late to work is lazy or irresponsible, without considering that they may be dealing with transportation issues or family emergencies that are out of their control. This tendency to attribute behavior solely to personal traits without considering external circumstances is a common manifestation of the fundamental attribution error.
