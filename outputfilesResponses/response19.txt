Discussion Questions:
1. On the one hand, failing to take action to control climate change can lead to severe consequences such as extreme weather events, rising sea levels, loss of biodiversity, and disruptions in food and water supply. On the other hand, acting to lower carbon emissions may cause short-term economic costs, potential job losses in certain industries, and disruptions in energy markets.
  
2. Humans have a moral responsibility to future generations due to the intergenerational nature of climate change. We must consider the long-term impacts of our actions on the well-being of future generations and the planet as a whole. This moral responsibility stems from the interconnectedness of human activities and the environment and the duty to preserve a sustainable world for those who will come after us.

3. Balancing the tangible costs of actions to reduce carbon emissions in the present with the abstract consequences in the future requires a careful consideration of both short-term and long-term benefits. It is essential to weigh the immediate economic burdens against the long-term environmental, social, and economic benefits that result from mitigating climate change. Investing in sustainable practices and technologies can lead to significant long-term gains that outweigh the immediate costs.

4. If recommending environmental policy changes, advocating for a combination of measures is crucial. This may include promoting renewable energy sources, implementing carbon pricing mechanisms, supporting energy efficiency initiatives, and investing in research and development of climate-friendly technologies. A holistic approach that considers the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of climate change is necessary for effective policy recommendations.

5. Prosperous countries have historically contributed more to greenhouse gas emissions and have greater resources to combat climate change. Therefore, they have a greater responsibility to take action and bear more of the costs of mitigation and adaptation efforts. However, developing countries should also receive support to transition to sustainable practices, as they may face challenges related to economic growth and poverty reduction.

6. Developing countries should not be exempt from taking actions to control climate change. While they may need to increase consumption and emissions for economic growth, it is essential for them to pursue sustainable development pathways that balance economic progress with environmental protection. International cooperation and support mechanisms can help developing nations address climate change challenges while promoting inclusive growth and environmental sustainability.

7. Imposing carbon emission goals on countries and individuals and enforcing them with penalties may be considered ethically permissible in the context of addressing a global crisis such as climate change. However, it is crucial to ensure that such measures are implemented fairly, transparently, and with consideration for the differing capacities and responsibilities of countries. Collaboration, dialogue, and incentivizing climate action are also important aspects of driving progress towards a more sustainable future.
