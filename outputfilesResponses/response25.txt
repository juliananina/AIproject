Based on the case study provided, here are responses to the discussion questions:

1. It could be more difficult for a younger athlete to resist a coachâ€™s unethical orders compared to an older athlete due to factors such as experience, knowledge, and confidence. Younger athletes might be more impressionable and less likely to challenge authority figures.

2. Resisting unethical instructions, such as being overly rough with opponents in sports, can be challenging for various reasons. A marginal player might find it harder to say no due to the fear of losing playing time and the associated benefits, whereas a star player might have more leverage and confidence to resist such instructions.

3. The scenario of the triple jumper feeling coerced by the coach to engage in doping but also acknowledging the wrongdoing can still be seen as a manifestation of the obedience to authority phenomenon. The athlete may have felt compelled due to the power dynamics involved in the athlete-coach relationship.

4. Resisting unethical instructions in a dictatorship might indeed be more challenging than in a corporation due to the extreme consequences and lack of freedom in such authoritarian regimes. The presence of informants like the STASI moles could further intensify the fear and pressure on individuals to comply.

5. Doctors and coaches in the GDR may have justified their actions to themselves by rationalizing that they were serving the state or fulfilling their duties as part of the system. To others, they might have used similar justifications or refrained from disclosing the truth due to fear of consequences.

6. Parallels can be drawn between the fear-based management styles in the GDR's doping program and cases like HealthSouth during the Enron era, where individuals felt intimidated and pressured to follow unethical directives from superiors.

7. Athletes who managed to resist authority in the GDR likely had a strong moral compass, confidence, and courage to stand up against wrongdoing, despite the potential repercussions. Personal values, ethics, and integrity could have enabled these athletes to resist the pressure.

8. Self-serving bias could indeed play a role in athletes' obedience to authority when it comes to cheating. The allure of benefits, social status, and privileges associated with sports stardom might influence individuals to rationalize or justify unethical behavior.

9. The self-serving bias might reinforce doctors' and coaches' obedience to authority in the GDR's doping scheme, as seeking personal gains or recognition could cloud their judgment and lead to compliance with unethical practices.

10. The observation by the GDR sports doctor reflects the tendency of individuals to rationalize their actions in harmful systems by shifting responsibility to external factors like orders or societal norms. The comparison to Nazi Germany highlights the dangers of blind obedience to authority.

11. Yuliya Stepanova's compliance with coaches' requests to engage in doping resembles obedience to authority, where individuals conform to instructions out of fear, pressure, or perceived necessity. The continuation of similar doping practices in Russia reflects a concerning pattern of unethical behavior in professional sports.

These responses offer insights into the ethical dilemmas, psychological factors, and power dynamics at play in the context of the GDR doping machine case study.
