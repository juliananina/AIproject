Discussion Questions:

1. How was ethical fading a part of Egil Krogh’s eventual journey to prison? Explain.
Ethical fading refers to the phenomenon where individuals gradually lose sight of the ethical aspects of a decision or action due to various factors such as pressure, authority influence, or self-interest. In Krogh's case, ethical fading was evident in his involvement in the Watergate scandal. Despite the illegal nature of the break-in he authorized, Krogh focused on the perceived necessity of the operation for national security, and the moral considerations faded away. This gradual erosion of ethical awareness eventually led Krogh to participate in illegal activities, culminating in his prison sentence.

2. At the time the decision was made, what factors caused the morality of the decision to break into the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist to fade from view?
Several factors contributed to the fading morality of the decision to break into Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office. Krogh and his team were under significant pressure from higher authorities like Nixon and Ehrlichman to stop leaks and protect national security. The urgency of the situation, coupled with the belief that they were acting in the nation's best interest, clouded their judgment regarding the ethical implications of their actions. Loyalty to their superiors, the lack of questioning the legality of the operation, and the focus on operational details instead of ethical considerations all contributed to the moral fade from view.

3. Krogh has said that he went into his White House job “with tremendous enthusiasm and commitment—almost to a fault.” Do you think this is reflective of his actions in the Nixon administration? Why or why not?
Krogh's initial enthusiasm and commitment to his White House job likely played a significant role in his subsequent actions during the Nixon administration. His strong dedication may have led him to be unquestioning of directives from authority figures, such as Nixon and Ehrlichman. This unwavering loyalty and enthusiasm may have contributed to his involvement in illegal activities, as he was driven by a desire to fulfill his duties and perceived obligations to the administration, even at the cost of ethical principles.

4. In what ways did authority figures affect Krogh’s actions? Explain.
Authority figures, such as Nixon and Ehrlichman, heavily influenced Krogh's actions throughout the Watergate scandal. They tasked him with stopping leaks and discrediting Ellsberg, pushing him to take drastic measures to achieve these goals. Krogh felt a sense of loyalty to these superiors, leading him to prioritize their instructions over ethical considerations. The authority figures' directives, combined with the pressure to maintain national security, played a significant role in shaping Krogh's decisions and actions, ultimately leading to his involvement in illegal activities.

5. How might one guard against ethical fading in a high-pressure work environment?
To guard against ethical fading in a high-pressure work environment, individuals can take several proactive steps. First, it is essential to cultivate a strong ethical foundation and regularly reflect on personal values and principles. Encouraging a culture of open communication and ethical discussions within the workplace can also help raise awareness of ethical considerations. Additionally, promoting transparency, accountability, and ethical decision-making processes can prevent individuals from succumbing to pressure or authority influence. Seeking feedback from diverse perspectives and considering the long-term consequences of decisions can further help individuals maintain ethical clarity in high-pressure situations.

6. Krogh believes that the Bush administration’s policies and practices regarding torture during the Iraq War reflect the same types of decision-making errors that he was guilty of regarding the plumbers’ operations. Do you agree? Why or why not?
Krogh draws parallels between the decision-making errors in the Nixon administration during the Watergate scandal and the Bush administration's policies on torture in the Iraq War. Both situations involved ethical lapses, rationalizations of illegal actions in the name of national security, and the influence of authority figures on individuals' decisions. While there may be similarities in terms of ethical fading and compromised integrity in both cases, it is essential to consider the specific contexts and complexities of each situation before drawing direct comparisons. Further analysis and examination of the ethical dimensions of each administration's actions are necessary to determine the extent of similarities and differences in decision-making errors.
