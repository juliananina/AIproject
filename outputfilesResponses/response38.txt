Discussion Questions:
1. Do you think Dr. Jones should discuss her reservations about flu vaccines with her senior patients? Why or why not?
- Dr. Jones faces a moral dilemma in balancing her duty to provide accurate information to her patients and potential repercussions from her institution and professional organization. It is essential for patients to make informed decisions about their health, so discussing her reservations could empower them to make choices that align with their values and preferences. However, she must carefully consider the impact of contradicting institutional guidelines and potential loss of job security.

2. Do you think Dr. Jones has a greater moral obligation to her family to protect her job security or to the recommendations of the AMA Code of Ethics, which encourage physicians to help patients exercise their “right of self-decision” by providing them with enough information to enable an informed choice? Explain your reasoning.
- Dr. Jones faces a conflict between personal interests, family obligations, and professional responsibilities. While job security is crucial for supporting her family, as a healthcare professional, she also has a duty to uphold ethical principles outlined by the AMA Code of Ethics. Ultimately, her primary obligation should be to prioritize patient welfare and autonomy by providing them with relevant information to make informed decisions about their healthcare.

3. Even if flu shots provide protection less than one fourth of the time, is it ethically permissible for Dr. Jones to decide that protection for some patients is better than none? And, on that basis, decide not to discuss the potential benefits and harms of flu shots with her patients? Explain.
- While imperfect, flu shots still offer some level of protection, and withholding information from patients about potential benefits and risks may undermine their ability to make educated choices. Dr. Jones should consider the ethical implications of depriving patients of key information that could impact their health outcomes, even if the protection provided by flu shots is less than optimal.

4. Do you think the AMA should promote open discussions about the efficacy of flu vaccines and support the development of blood tests that could predict that efficacy? Why or why not? What are the potential outcomes?
- The AMA should encourage open dialogue regarding the efficacy of flu vaccines to ensure transparency and promote patient-centered care. Supporting research to develop blood tests that predict vaccine efficacy could enhance personalized medicine and enable healthcare providers to tailor recommendations based on individual patient profiles. This approach may lead to more informed decision-making, increased patient trust, and improved public health outcomes.

5. Both the AMA Code of Ethics and the World Health Organization endorse the primary “right of self-decision” of all patients regarding their health care. However, to foster “herd immunity,” the bill SB 277 was recently passed in the state of California, mandating multiple doses of vaccinations for all students entering kindergarten. Do you think there is a way to reconcile these two opposing ethical goals? Explain.
- Balancing the right of individual autonomy with public health goals such as herd immunity can be challenging. It requires a nuanced approach that respects both individual rights and the collective benefit of vaccination programs. Education, communication, and public health campaigns can help reconcile these goals by emphasizing the importance of vaccination for individual and community well-being while respecting individual decision-making within ethical boundaries.
