Discussion Questions:

1. In this case, who favors the individualistic fundamental moral unit? Who favors the community-oriented fundamental moral unit? Which viewpoint do you find the most compelling and why?
- Those who supported the Welfare Reform Act, particularly Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich and his colleagues, favored the individualistic fundamental moral unit. They believed in the values of individual responsibility, hard work, and independence. On the other hand, critics of the bill, such as Senator Edward Kennedy and Peter Edelman, favored the community-oriented fundamental moral unit. They emphasized society's responsibility to care for the vulnerable and challenged the idea of individualism solely solving social issues. The most compelling viewpoint may vary depending on personal beliefs and values. Some may find the emphasis on self-reliance and independence compelling, while others may prioritize social responsibility and solidarity.

2. Regardless of your own political affiliation, do you think governments or societies have an obligation to care for disadvantaged or lower-income families? Why or why not?
- Governments and societies play crucial roles in addressing social inequalities and supporting disadvantaged individuals and families. Providing a safety net for those in need can contribute to a more equitable society and reduce poverty. Policies that help lift individuals out of poverty, improve access to education and healthcare, and create opportunities for economic mobility demonstrate a commitment to social welfare. Thus, it can be argued that governments and societies share an obligation to care for disadvantaged or lower-income families to promote social justice and well-being.

3. Do you think everyone in your home country has equal opportunities to succeed in society? Why or why not? Do you think success is the sole responsibility of the individual or does the government have a role to play? Explain your position.
- Equal opportunities for success in society are often influenced by various factors such as socio-economic background, education, access to resources, discrimination, and systemic inequalities. While some individuals may have more advantages than others, it is essential for governments to create policies that level the playing field and address disparities. Success is not solely the responsibility of the individual; systemic barriers can hinder progress for many. Government intervention through social welfare programs, education initiatives, job training, and support for marginalized populations plays a crucial role in promoting equal opportunities and addressing systemic inequalities.

4. How might individuals raised with different notions of the fundamental moral unit respond differently to the Welfare Reform Act?
- Individuals raised with a strong emphasis on individualistic values may be more likely to support the Welfare Reform Act. They may see it as promoting self-reliance, hard work, and personal accountability. On the other hand, those raised with community-oriented values might oppose the act, viewing it as neglecting the needs of the vulnerable and disadvantaged in society. Their response could be driven by a belief in collective responsibility, social welfare, and solidarity.

5. How might awareness of the fundamental moral unit help us to better understand differences between political parties?
- Awareness of the fundamental moral unit, whether individualistic or community-oriented, can shed light on the ideological differences between political parties. Parties that prioritize individual responsibility and limited government intervention may align more with individualistic values. In contrast, parties that emphasize social welfare, equality, and community support may resonate with a community-oriented moral unit. Understanding these underlying values can help explain the divergent perspectives on policies like welfare reform and other social issues.
