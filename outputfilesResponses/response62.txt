1. Loss aversion was apparent in Nick Leeson's conduct through his strong reluctance to admit and address the initial losses he incurred. He hid the losses in an error account and continued to engage in speculative trading in an attempt to recover the losses, even though it led to even bigger losses. Leeson's fear of failure and the associated humiliation drove him to take risky actions to avoid acknowledging the losses.

2. All three explanations provided by Judith Rawnsley likely played a role in Leeson's behavior. His loss aversion stemming from fear, combined with ego and greed exacerbated by the trading environment, as well as distorted thinking patterns under stress like overconfidence and denial, contributed to the catastrophic outcome. The pressure to maintain his reputation and success, along with the culture of risky trading, likely intensified these behaviors.

3. The blame in this case can be attributed to both Leeson individually and the system within which he operated. While Leeson's actions were deceptive and driven by his own motivations, the lack of supervision and oversight by Barings Bank allowed him to engage in unauthorized trading and hide his losses. The system's failure to detect and prevent such risky behavior also played a significant role in the bank's collapse.

4. If placed in Leeson's position after the initial loss, it would have been crucial to immediately report the loss, seek guidance from superiors, and work towards a transparent and responsible solution. Admitting mistakes promptly and addressing them openly is key to preventing further damage and maintaining trust within the organization.

5. Owning up to mistakes can be challenging for many individuals, including those who may fear repercussions or damage to their reputation. However, acknowledging and taking responsibility for mistakes is important for growth and learning. Leading by example and encouraging a culture of accountability and transparency can help individuals and organizations address errors effectively and prevent similar situations in the future.
