Discussion Questions:

1. Loss aversion may have played a role in Lochte's "overexaggeration" as he was still intoxicated and going through the emotions of having a gun pulled on him. Loss aversion, in this context, could have increased Lochte's fear of the potential consequences of the situation and led him to exaggerate the events to potentially mitigate those consequences.

2. Lochte's temptation to lie to cover up his mistake could be relatable to individuals who have been in similar situations where the instinct to protect oneself takes over. Understanding the fear of repercussions or embarrassment may have driven Lochte to fabricate the story initially.

3. It is plausible that Lochte's endorsement deals and the potential loss of revenue streams could have influenced his decision to "overexaggerate" to avoid jeopardizing those lucrative partnerships. The fear of losing significant financial stability could have been a motivating factor for him.

4. The outrage directed at Lochte was primarily due to his apparent lie rather than his drunken behavior, highlighting the common viewpoint that "the cover-up is worse than the crime." The deceit and attempt to manipulate the narrative seemed to escalate the situation and overshadow the initial inappropriate behavior.

5. Professor William Earnest's statement that people lie to avoid punishment and embarrassment aligns with the human tendency to protect oneself from negative consequences. Fear of punishment and potential shame often drive individuals to resort to deception.

6. Jose Canseco's perspective on athletes using steroids to avoid losing their jobs resonates with the concept of loss aversion. The fear of losing their livelihood and status in their sport could be a powerful motivator for athletes to engage in unethical behavior to sustain their careers.

7. To prevent feelings of loss aversion from leading to moral mistakes, individuals can prepare by developing a strong ethical framework, understanding the potential consequences of dishonesty, and seeking support or guidance when faced with difficult decisions. Maintaining accountability, honesty, and integrity can serve as protective measures against succumbing to the pressures of loss aversion.
