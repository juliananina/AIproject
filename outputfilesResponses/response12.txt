1. Those opposing the research argue that harm is done by conducting crash tests with cadavers because they believe it violates the human dignity of the deceased individuals. They view using cadavers as unethical and argue that such testing should be conducted with manikins or other non-human models. On the other hand, researchers argue that the harm done by not conducting the research is the potential loss of valuable data that could help save lives by improving car safety through more accurate testing techniques.

2. The moral agents involved in this case include the researchers, the university officials, family members of the deceased individuals, government officials, and societal groups expressing dissent. The subjects of moral worth can be viewed as both the deceased cadavers themselves and the potential future victims of car accidents who could benefit from improved safety measures. In this case, the moral worth of the deceased cadavers is in question due to the ethical concerns raised by various parties.

3. The idea of human dignity may be interpreted differently in the context of the living and the dead. Some may argue that human dignity applies equally to both, as respect for an individual's dignity should be maintained even after death. Others may argue that there are distinctions between the living and the dead regarding the application of human dignity, especially when it comes to issues of consent and bodily integrity.

4. The degree to which family members have the capacity to make decisions or give consent on behalf of their deceased relatives can vary based on cultural, legal, and ethical considerations. While family members should have a say in matters involving their deceased loved ones, other considerations such as communal values, legal restrictions, and research ethics should also be taken into account to ensure that ethical standards are upheld and societal interests are considered.

5. Research using cadavers and organ donation both involve the use of human bodies for scientific purposes. While both practices raise ethical questions, organ donation is typically seen as a voluntary act that benefits living individuals in need of organs, whereas using cadavers for research may raise concerns about consent and the treatment of deceased individuals. The permissibility of each practice can depend on various factors, including consent, respect for human dignity, and societal benefits.

6. Compared to research using cadavers, animal testing presents another ethical dilemma involving the use of living sentient beings for scientific research. While there are debates regarding the ethical implications of both practices, some argue that using cadavers may be more ethically permissible than animal testing due to the lack of consciousness in deceased individuals. However, both practices raise concerns about respecting the lives and dignity of beings used in research.
