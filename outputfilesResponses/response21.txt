Discussion Questions:

1. In trying to teach the student a lesson about taking responsibility for her actions, did the teacher go too far and become a bully? Why or why not? Does she deserve to be fired for her actions?
- The teacher confronting the student publicly and posting the video online may be seen as a strong reaction. Whether she became a bully depends on how her actions were perceived and the impact they had on the student. Whether she deserves to be fired would depend on the school's policies and the severity of her actions.

2. What punishment does the student deserve? Why?
- The student's actions of cyber harassment were hurtful and damaging to the teacher's reputation. The appropriate punishment would depend on the school's disciplinary policies and the level of harm caused by the student's behavior.

3. Who is the victim in this case? The teacher or the student? Was one victimized more than the other? Explain.
- Both the teacher and the student were victims in different ways. The teacher was subjected to cyber harassment, affecting her reputation, while the student may have faced consequences for her actions. The level of victimization would depend on the impact of the harassment on each party.

4. Do victims have the right to defend themselves against bullies? What if they go through the proper channels to report bullying and it doesn’t stop?
- Victims have the right to defend themselves against bullies, including taking appropriate actions to stop the harassment. If reporting bullying through proper channels does not stop the behavior, further steps may need to be taken to ensure the victim's safety and well-being.

5. How should compassion play a role in judging other’s actions?
- Compassion should be used to understand the underlying motives and circumstances behind someone's actions. Judging others with compassion can lead to more empathetic and constructive responses to problematic behaviors.

6. How are factors like age and gender used to “excuse” unethical behavior? (ie. “Boys will be boys” or “She’s too young/old to understand that what she did is wrong”) Can you think of any other factors that are sometimes used to excuse unethical behavior?
- Age and gender stereotypes are often used to excuse unethical behavior by attributing it to natural inclinations or immaturity. Other factors like social status, cultural background, or peer influence may also be used as excuses for unethical behavior.

7. How is cyberbullying similar or different from face-to-face bullying? Is one more harmful than the other? Explain.
- Cyberbullying and face-to-face bullying share similarities in terms of causing harm, intimidation, and harassment. However, cyberbullying can reach a wider audience quickly and may have a longer-lasting impact due to the permanence of digital content. The harm caused can be subjective based on individual experiences.

8. Do you know anyone who has been the victim of cyberbullying? What types of harm did this person experience?
- This question prompts personal reflection and experience, focusing on the real impact of cyberbullying. Sharing anecdotes or stories related to cyberbullying can provide insight into the diverse ways individuals are affected by online harassment.
