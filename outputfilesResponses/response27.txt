Discussion Questions:
1. **Values in Conflict:** In this case, the values of government secrecy and national security are in conflict with the values of transparency, privacy, and individual rights. Snowden's actions caused harm by potentially compromising national security and damaging the intelligence community's ability to operate covertly. However, his actions also brought benefits by exposing government surveillance programs and sparking a debate about privacy rights.

2. **Ethical Justification:** Whether Snowden's actions were ethically justified even if legally prohibited is a complex question. One argument supporting Snowden is that he acted out of a sense of duty to inform the public and protect their privacy rights, thus aligning with values of transparency and accountability. On the other hand, leaking classified information can harm national security and government operations, conflicting with the value of protecting the country. You can argue for or against Snowden's actions by considering the balance between individual rights and societal security.

3. **Personal Decision:** If you were in Snowden's position, your decision might depend on your personal values and beliefs. Some might prioritize loyalty to the government and following the law, while others might prioritize upholding individual rights and standing up against perceived injustices. Considering the potential consequences of your actions and the moral dilemmas involved would be crucial in making such a decision.

4. **Impact on Lives:** The ethical dilemma regarding Snowden's actions becomes more complex when considering potential loss of life among CIA operatives or the possibility of saving lives through his leak. If you knew that lives were at risk due to the leaked information, it could challenge the ethical justification of his actions. Considering the balance between national security and individual rights while prioritizing human lives would be essential in reassessing your position.

5. **Ethical Whistleblowing:** Whistleblowing can be ethically ideal when it exposes significant wrongdoing or threats to public safety that cannot be addressed through internal channels. However, it might be prohibited when the act compromises national security or puts lives at risk without sufficient justification. Determining the ethical boundaries of whistleblowing involves weighing the potential benefits of transparency against the potential harms to individuals or society.

By carefully considering the competing values, ethical principles, and potential consequences in this case, you can develop a well-rounded analysis and argument regarding Edward Snowden's actions as a traitor or hero.
