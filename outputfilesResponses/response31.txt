### Discussion Questions:

1. **In this case study, who voiced his or her values? Do you think each of these people acted effectively? Why or why not?**

   Various individuals in the case study, such as Erika Christakis, Nicholas Christakis, Jonathan Butler, Tim Tai, and university administrators, voiced their values. Whether they acted effectively is subjective and depends on one's perspective. Erika Christakis and Nicholas Christakis stood by principles of free speech, challenging sensitivity protocols. Jonathan Butler went on a hunger strike to protest racial tensions, leading to the resignation of Tim Wolfe. University administrators faced criticism for slow responses. Overall, their effectiveness can be debated based on their impact and the outcomes of their actions.

2. **Think through the seven pillars of GVV in relation to Erika Christakis’s actions. Can you identify each pillar in her actions? Are there any pillars that you think she could have engaged more effectively? Explain.**

   Erika Christakis demonstrated aspects of Giving Voice to Values (GVV) by voicing her opinions on free speech and challenging the call for sensitivity. She upheld the pillars of values, choice, voice, reasons, and rationalizations, effectively expressing her viewpoint. However, she could have engaged the pillar of negotiation more effectively by seeking common ground or understanding with the students who signed the open letter.

3. **How do Erika Christakis’s actions to voice values compare to Jonathan Butler’s actions to voice values? Was one more effective than the other? Why or why not? Explain.**

   Erika Christakis and Jonathan Butler both voiced their values but through different means: Christakis through discourse and Butler through a hunger strike. Effectiveness depends on the desired outcomes; Butler's actions led to the resignation of Tim Wolfe, achieving a tangible result. Christakis’s actions sparked debate but may not have resulted in concrete change.

4. **If you were in the position of a student activist at Yale or Missouri, what would you have done and why? How might the pillars of GVV influence your actions?**

   As a student activist, one might engage in peaceful protests, dialogue with administration, and advocate for change through constructive means. The pillars of GVV could guide actions by clarifying values, identifying objections, developing strategies for communication, and implementing plans to voice concerns effectively.

5. **What if you were in the position of a university administrator at Yale or Missouri? What would you have done and why? How might the pillars of GVV influence your actions?**

   As a university administrator, one might prioritize addressing grievances, promoting inclusivity, and facilitating dialogue between students and faculty. GVV could guide actions by helping administrators align decisions with ethical values, address objections, and communicate transparently to build trust and understanding.

6. **If you were in the position to mediate the conflict between Tim Tai and the protesters, how would you engage the GVV pillars to do so? Explain.**

   Mediating the conflict would involve understanding and respecting both perspectives, facilitating dialogue, finding common ground, and advocating for civil discourse. Engaging the GVV pillars would help in articulating values, addressing concerns, and negotiating solutions that respect freedom of speech while acknowledging safe spaces.

7. **If you were in Tai’s position, what would you have done, and why? Do you agree with his argument that freedom of speech protects his rights as much as it does the protesters? Explain.**

   Tim Tai’s defense of free speech while covering the protests exemplifies his commitment to journalistic integrity. As a journalist, Tai aimed to document the events impartially, upholding freedom of the press. His argument for freedom of speech protecting both his and protesters’ rights is valid, emphasizing the importance of impartial reporting and open discourse.

These questions invite critical reflection on the case study and encourage ethical analysis of the actions and interactions observed in the scenario.
