Discussion Questions:
1. Enron's CEO and employees framed their business model as one that operated with the highest ethical standards. However, in reality, their actions were unethical, involving schemes to manipulate markets for their financial gain. This difference in framing allowed them to justify their behavior as profitable and not necessarily wrong, despite the negative impact on customers and the market.
2. Framing can influence people's approaches to business conduct by shaping their perceptions of what is acceptable or appropriate behavior. If a business frames its actions as advantageous or necessary for success, employees may be more inclined to engage in unethical practices without fully realizing the consequences. Framing can create a mindset that justifies unethical behavior as a means to achieve desired outcomes.
3. Other framing tactics used by different businesses may include presenting products or services in a way that highlights their benefits while downplaying any negative aspects, using deceptive advertising to create a false perception of value, or manipulating data to support a particular narrative. Framing can impact consumer decisions by influencing their perceptions and emotions, leading them to make choices based on skewed information or incomplete understanding.
4. The recorded conversation between two Enron employees reveals their casual attitude towards deceitful practices. The dialogue suggests that they view lying as a necessary part of marketing rather than as unethical behavior. This indicates how framing can distort perceptions of right and wrong, blurring the lines between acceptable business practices and fraud.
5. If you were a new employee starting your career at Enron and learned of the framing tactics in this case study, it would be crucial to uphold ethical standards and integrity in your own conduct. Recognizing the negative consequences of unethical behavior and the damaging effects of deception on stakeholders, it would be important to resist pressures to engage in fraudulent practices and instead report any unethical behavior to the appropriate authorities. Ultimately, maintaining personal and professional integrity is key in upholding ethical standards in the face of organizational misconduct.
