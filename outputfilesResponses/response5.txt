Here are the answers to the discussion questions based on the case study provided:

1. Artistic appropriation can be seen as both a positive and negative practice. Positively, it allows artists to engage with existing cultural symbols and create new meanings or critiques through their work. It can also be a way to pay homage to or reference previous artists. However, appropriation can also raise questions of originality, ownership, and exploitation of others' work. The medium in which the artist works can influence how appropriation is perceived, as different mediums may have varying conventions and expectations regarding the use of existing content.

2. Appropriation is not solely ethically questionable when money or popularity are involved. The ethical concerns of appropriation relate more to issues of intellectual property, respect for the original creator, and the potential harm caused by the appropriation. These concerns can arise regardless of financial gain or fame resulting from the appropriation.

3. Warhol's use of the Campbell's soup cans and Fairey's use of Garcia's photograph differ in their approaches to appropriation. Warhol's work recontextualized a mass-produced object, whereas Fairey directly used a specific photograph. Both works transform the original content, but Fairey's work was based on a singular image and involved issues of copyright ownership. The ethical considerations may vary depending on the context of the appropriation and the intentions of the artist.

4. Fairey's preemptive lawsuit against the Associated Press can be seen as a strategic move to protect his fair use rights while also potentially acknowledging the contentious nature of using copyrighted material. By seeking legal clarification on fair use, Fairey aimed to defend his artistic process and the transformative nature of his work. However, some may view this act as an admission of copyright infringement, as it implies uncertainty regarding the legality of the appropriation.

5. Moral intent can play a role in instances of artistic appropriation, as it can provide insight into the artist's motives and ethical considerations. Artists who appropriate with respect, integrity, and a clear transformative vision may be seen more favorably than those who appropriate carelessly or exploitatively. However, ultimately, the impact of the new work and the extent to which it recontextualizes the original piece are crucial factors in determining the ethical and artistic value of the appropriation.
