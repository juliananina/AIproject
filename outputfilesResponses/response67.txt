Discussion Questions:

1. How did this happen? Why did the parents do it? With a couple of exceptions, most of Singer’s clients led honorable lives and seem unlikely to have paid bribes in order to advance their own careers or financial situations. But these parents were willing to do so in order to get their kids into the college of their choice. Is it possible that while playing the role of “loving parent,” these parents thought they had to do these things to protect their kids from disappointment and failure? Could role morality have played a part here? Explain.
- This situation likely occurred due to a combination of factors, including parents wanting to fulfill their children's dreams and feeling pressure to ensure their success. The desire to protect their children from disappointment and failure could have led these parents to justify unethical actions as necessary for their children's well-being. Role morality might have played a part as parents may have viewed themselves as fulfilling the role of devoted parents by going to extreme lengths to secure their children's admission to prestigious colleges.

2. According to Korn and Levitz, while working with Singer, mother Jane Buckingham wanted (more than anything) to help her son. Her main thought was: “If there’s something I can do, I should do it.” Does this sound like a person playing the role of “devoted parent”? Why or why not? 
- Jane Buckingham's actions do align with someone who is dedicated to helping her child succeed. However, her actions crossed ethical boundaries as she resorted to cheating and bribery. While her intentions may have been rooted in parental love and support, her choices deviate from the ethical standards expected of a devoted parent.

3. Psychologist Daniel Houser and colleagues ran an experiment where parents were given the opportunity to cheat under various circumstances. They found that parents were most likely to cheat when (a) it benefited their children rather than themselves, and (b) the children were not present. When children were present, parents cheated less, presumably to model good behavior for their kids. Does this experimental result seem to accord with the facts on the ground in the Varsity Blues scandal? Explain your reasoning.
- The experimental results align with the Varsity Blues scandal in terms of parents cheating to benefit their children. The parents in the scandal may have rationalized their actions as necessary for securing their children's future, hence prioritizing their children's interests over ethical considerations. The presence or absence of children during the cheating incidents may have influenced the extent to which parents were willing to engage in unethical behavior.

4. Regarding role morality, psychologist Keith Levitt has explained: “When people switch hats, they often switch moral compasses. People like to think they are inherently moral creatures – you either have character or you don’t. But our studies show that the same person may make a completely different decision based on what hat they may be wearing at the time, often without even realizing it.” Does this passage help explain how Gordie Caplan could preach integrity while playing the role of head of a law firm, yet cheat while playing the role of devoted parent? Or how Douglas Hodge could be a great philanthropist while playing the role of “good citizen” while being a cheater while playing the role of devoted parent? Discuss.
- This passage highlights the concept of role morality, where individuals may justify different actions based on the roles they assume. In the case of Gordie Caplan and Douglas Hodge, they may have compartmentalized their behavior according to the specific roles they were playing. While their professional roles emphasized integrity and philanthropy, respectively, their roles as parents might have led them to justify unethical actions in order to ensure their children's success.

5. Kweku Adoboli and Jane Buckingham both engaged in actions they knew were wrong, with Adoboli justifying his actions as being for the benefit of the bank, and Buckingham doing so for her son’s benefit. Discuss the parallels between Adoboli’s role as a loyal employee and Buckingham’s role as a devoted parent. How did both individuals use their roles to justify their actions despite knowing they were wrong?
- Both Adoboli and Buckingham leveraged their roles – as a loyal employee and a devoted parent, respectively – to rationalize their unethical behavior. Adoboli believed he was acting in the interest of the bank, while Buckingham convinced herself that she was helping her son by resorting to fraud and bribery. By aligning their actions with the perceived expectations of their roles, they were able to justify their misconduct even though they were aware it was unethical.

6. When parents told themselves that they needed to pay a bribe to prevent their kids from being crushed by the disappointment of not being accepted into their desired school, do you think they were also motivated by the potential disappointment and desire for bragging rights that would come from their children’s admission to prestigious schools?
a. Did the self-serving bias play a part in this situation, and why?
b. Which influence do you think was stronger – role morality or the self-serving bias?
- Parents may have been influenced by a combination of factors, including the fear of disappointment and a desire for social status associated with their children's admission to prestigious schools. The self-serving bias might have played a role as parents likely prioritized their own emotional well-being and social standing through their children's success. While role morality could have influenced their decisions to justify their actions as necessary for their children's future, the self-serving bias may have been a stronger motivator in seeking personal validation and societal approval through their children's achievements.

7. Was framing also an issue in the Varsity Blues scandal? Did the parents' intense focus on the desired outcome of their children's admission override moral considerations? Share your thoughts and reasons.
- Framing could have played a significant role in the scandal, with parents potentially prioritizing the outcome of securing their children's admission over ethical concerns. The intense focus on achieving the desired outcome might have led parents to rationalize unethical behavior as a means to an end, overshadowing moral considerations and ethical dilemmas they faced.

8. According to Nicole LaPorte, Singer used tactics to normalize fraudulent behavior by insinuating that admissions through connections and donations were common practice. Do you think the conformity bias contributed to the parents' collective acceptance of fraud and bribery in the Varsity Blues scandal? Explain your reasoning.
- The conformity bias might have influenced parents in the Varsity Blues scandal by creating a perception that engaging in fraudulent schemes was a norm within certain circles or necessary for securing admission to elite colleges. By presenting fraudulent behavior as commonplace or acceptable due to the actions of others, Singer may have exploited the conformity bias to justify these actions to the parents involved.

These discussion questions provide insight into the ethical considerations, psychological motivations, and societal influences that contributed to the Varsity Blues scandal, prompting critical reflection on the complex interplay of factors in such high-stakes situations.
