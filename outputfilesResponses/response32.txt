Discussion Questions:

1. Role morality in the case of Kim Davis:
Role morality is evident in the case of Kim Davis as she faced a conflict between her religious beliefs and her duty as a county clerk to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. Davis believed she was following her conscience and fulfilling her duties to God by refusing to issue the licenses. Role morality may not be ethically permissible in this situation as public officials are expected to uphold the law regardless of personal beliefs.

2. Role morality in the case of the social worker:
In the case of the social worker, role morality is evident as the social worker grapples with the conflict between personal religious beliefs and professional duty to provide unbiased mental health treatment. It may not be ethically permissible for the social worker to adhere to role morality in this situation as providing quality and unbiased care to the client should be the primary focus.

3. Mental health providers declining services based on personal beliefs:
Mental health providers should not be able to decline services to individuals based on their own moral judgments. Clinicians should not have the freedom to select who they wish to treat based on their values or beliefs as it goes against the ethical principles of providing non-discriminatory care and respecting client autonomy.

4. Impact on the client of working with a biased clinician:
It is not fair to the client if mental health services are provided by a social worker who harbors animosity or condemnation toward the client based on their sexual orientation. The client would be better served by a clinician who does not hold such biased beliefs as it can impact the therapeutic relationship and undermine the client's progress.

5. Disclosure of sexual orientation and provider assignments:
Clients should not be required to disclose their sexual orientation upon admission to mental health facilities. If a client reveals their sexual orientation during treatment and the therapist harbors biases, it may be harmful to the client to continue working with that therapist. In such cases, a transfer to another therapist should be considered to ensure the client receives unbiased care.

6. Limited staffing options in rural mental health clinics:
In cases where it is not possible to refer the client to another therapist due to limited staffing options, the social worker should seek supervision or consultation to navigate the ethical dilemma. The social worker should strive to maintain objectivity and seek support to ensure the client's needs are being met effectively.

7. Advocacy for oppressed minority groups vs. religious objections:
The requirements included in the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics to advocate for oppressed minority groups should outweigh sincere religious objections held by social workers. Social workers have a professional duty to prioritize social justice and equality, even if it conflicts with personal beliefs. Advocating for oppressed groups aligns with the core values of social work and ethical practice.
