Discussion Questions:

1. While Hannan and Grantland were legally permitted to publish the article, the ethical permissibility is debated. Some argue that exposing Vanderbilt's personal life and outing her as transgender crossed ethical boundaries, especially since she wished to maintain her privacy. Others believe that reporting all the facts, including Vanderbilt's deception, was important. Ultimately, the ethical dilemma lies in balancing the pursuit of truth with respect for individuals' privacy and dignity.

2. If I were in Hannan's position investigating Vanderbilt, I would have focused on the scientific aspects of the putter, as agreed upon with Vanderbilt. I would have respected her privacy and not pursued details about her personal life or background that were unrelated to the story at hand. This would involve a clear boundary between professional investigation and personal intrusion.

3. Hannan may have been influenced by biases against Vanderbilt due to her history of deceit and felt pressure to uncover the truth for the sake of journalistic integrity. He may have rationalized his actions by believing that exposing her deception was in the public interest and outweighed her desire for privacy. This indicates a potential lack of empathy and understanding towards Vanderbilt's circumstances.

4. If I were in Simmons' position before publishing the article, I would have considered the potential consequences of outing Vanderbilt as transgender and the impact it could have on her well-being. I would have carefully reviewed the article with a sensitivity towards marginalized communities and consulted with experts on reporting responsibly about transgender individuals.

5. Simmons may have been influenced by biases towards sensational reporting and the pressure to generate buzzworthy content. He may have rationalized publishing the article by prioritizing the need for transparency and honesty in journalism. This highlights the challenges in balancing the pursuit of truth with ethical considerations, such as respecting individuals' privacy and dignity.

6. Balancing comprehensive reporting and truth in journalism with respecting individuals' privacy requires careful consideration of the potential harm that disclosure may cause. Assessing whether pursuing a story is "worth it" entails weighing the public interest in knowing the truth against the potential harm or damage it may cause to the individuals involved. Journalists must act with empathy, integrity, and respect for all individuals, especially those who may be vulnerable to harm or discrimination.

7. Journalists do bear a special responsibility to individuals who may be at risk of harm or face oppression based on their identity. While uncovering the truth is essential in journalism, it should be done with sensitivity and respect towards marginalized communities. There is a fine line between transparency and exploitation, and journalists must navigate this line carefully to avoid contributing to harm or discrimination against vulnerable populations. Ethical journalism demands a commitment to truth while upholding the dignity and rights of all individuals.
