Discussion Questions:

1. According to those opposing the legislation, limiting women's freedom to terminate a pregnancy is seen as interference with medical decisions following a complicated diagnosis. They argue that the legislation would violate the legal right to abortion as established in Roe v. Wade. On the other hand, supporters of the legislation believe that limiting women's freedom to terminate a pregnancy is necessary to protect babies born with disabilities and reduce the number of abortions performed for selective reasons.

2. The moral agents in this case include the pregnant women, the fetus with genetic abnormalities, lawmakers, medical professionals, advocacy groups, and society in general. The subjects of moral worth are debatable, but could include the pregnant women, the fetuses with genetic abnormalities, and babies with disabilities. The reasoning behind this is that the pregnant women have autonomy and rights over their bodies, the fetuses are the potential recipients of either life or termination, and the babies with disabilities deserve protection and support.

3. It is a complex ethical issue whether it is permissible to limit the freedom of women who do not wish to bear babies with birth defects if the diagnosis and procedure take place in the first trimester. While Roe v. Wade allows first-trimester abortions, the ethical considerations should involve balancing the rights of the pregnant women with the welfare of the fetus. The decision may depend on various factors such as the severity of the genetic abnormality and the potential quality of life for the baby.

4. Allowing the legal abortion of babies with disabilities like Down syndrome can convey a message about the value society places on the lives of persons with disabilities. It raises concerns about discrimination and the worth of individuals with disabilities, suggesting that their lives are less valuable compared to those without disabilities.

5. If the Legislature criminalizes abortion in cases related to specific diagnoses like Down syndrome, there is an ethical responsibility to ensure that poor families are not driven into bankruptcy by the high medical and educational costs of raising children with disabilities. It involves considering social justice and equity issues to prevent financial burdens on families already facing hardships.

6. Requiring physicians to divulge the motivation for terminating a pregnancy raises ethical dilemmas regarding doctor-patient confidentiality. While transparency and ethics in medical decision-making are crucial, breaching confidentiality can erode trust between patients and healthcare providers. It may be challenging to find a balance between respecting patient privacy and ensuring ethical practices in medical care.

7. The freedom of parents to decide whether to abort for reasons such as genetic defects like deafness or diabetes can be a contentious issue. In a free society, the government faces challenges in limiting reproductive options while balancing individual rights and societal interests. The decision involves weighing ethical considerations, including the well-being of the family and the potential impact on the child's future quality of life.
