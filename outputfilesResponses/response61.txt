Discussion Questions:

1. The person most subject to bounded ethicality in this case could be argued to be Richard Armitage, as he was the one who initially disclosed Valerie Plame's identity to the press. Armitage may have felt justified in his actions due to the perceived need to defend the Bush administration's narrative regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. This situational pressure may have led him to overlook the ethical boundaries of disclosing classified information.

2. The situational factors in this case, such as the pressure to maintain political narratives, national security concerns, and personal loyalties, posed challenges for those involved to act ethically. The intense political climate surrounding the Iraq War and the desire to protect the reputation of the administration likely influenced the decisions made by individuals like Libby, Rove, and Cheney.

3. Bush, Cheney, and Libby were subject to bounded ethicality as they were caught in a web of organizational pressures and psychological factors. Cheney's loyalty to Libby may have clouded his judgment, while Libby's desire to protect the administration led to his perjury charges. Bush was torn between conflicting interests, potentially compromising ethical considerations in his decision-making.

4. President Bush's actions were ethically challenging as he was entangled in conflicting loyalties and interests. While he attempted to uphold the rule of law by allowing the legal process to proceed, his administration's involvement in the leak created ethical dilemmas that were difficult to navigate. It can be argued that Bush's actions were not ethically ideal due to the complications of the situation.

5. If in President Bush's position, one might have prioritized transparency and accountability by swiftly addressing the leak and ensuring consequences for those responsible. Open communication with all parties involved, including Plame, Wilson, and the CIA, could have been crucial in handling the situation ethically and minimizing harm to those affected.

6. The ethical permissibility of pardoning Libby is debatable. While pardons are within the president's constitutional authority, pardoning someone convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice raises questions about accountability and the rule of law. Considering the potential harm caused by the leak and the subsequent legal proceedings, some might argue that pardoning Libby was not ethically justified.

7. Plame's concerns about the pardon causing further harm are valid, as it could potentially undermine trust in the justice system and national security institutions. Pardoning Libby may send a message that certain individuals are above the law, which could damage the integrity of legal processes and jeopardize the safety of classified operations and personnel.
