**Analysis of the Case Study:**

The case study of the incident at Starbucks highlights issues of racial bias and discrimination that occurred in one of the company's Philadelphia locations. The incident involved the wrongful arrest of two black men, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, who were waiting for a business meeting at the store. They were confronted by a store manager, denied access to use the restroom, and eventually arrested for trespassing after the police were called.

Starbucks faced significant backlash following the incident, leading to public apologies from CEO Kevin Johnson and the decision to close all company-owned stores for a day of racial-bias education. The company's response aimed at addressing implicit bias and ensuring a welcoming environment for all customers.

**Discussion Questions:**

1. The captions on the photos published after Hurricane Katrina showcase racial bias in how the same scenario is described differently based on the race of the individuals. The writers may not have consciously thought of themselves as racist, but their language perpetuated racist stereotypes.

2. Whether the manager of the Starbucks in Philadelphia consciously thought of herself as racist is unclear. However, her actions reflect possible implicit bias based on the treatment of Nelson and Robinson.

3. It is likely that the situation would have been handled differently had Nelson and Robinson been white, indicating potential bias and discrimination based on race.

4. Stereotypes of criminality or suspicious behavior may have been invoked in this case, particularly towards black individuals. The police, manager, and bystanders may have held different stereotypes, consciously or unconsciously.

5. Stereotyping influenced the situation by framing the actions of the manager and police officers towards Nelson and Robinson. Bystanders may also have been influenced by implicit biases in their perceptions and reactions.

6. Starbucks' response to the incident was proactive in addressing the issue of racial bias and discrimination within its stores. The decision to conduct racial-bias education and apologize publicly was a step towards acknowledging and rectifying the situation.

7. The training session on implicit bias planned by Starbucks has the potential to have a beneficial impact by raising awareness and promoting a more inclusive and respectful environment within the company.

8. The examples provided indicate instances of implicit bias where individuals are treated differently based on factors such as race, age, or weight, rather than on objective criteria.

9. Examples of implicit bias can be observed in everyday interactions, such as assumptions based on appearance, language, or cultural background that lead to discriminatory actions.

10. Implicit bias is a serious problem as it can influence decisions, behaviors, and interactions in subtle ways. It may be more pervasive than explicit bias, as individuals may not recognize their own biases or the impact they have.

Overall, addressing implicit bias is a crucial step towards promoting equality and fairness in all aspects of society, as exemplified by the Starbucks case study.
