1. The VA scandal is clearly an example of incentive gaming where administrators manipulated data and processes to achieve the desired outcomes of reduced wait times in order to qualify for bonuses. By misrepresenting wait times, using multiple sets of records, and exploiting loopholes, the administrators took advantage of the incentive system to receive financial rewards.

2. Performance incentives can be effective in increasing productivity when properly structured and aligned with organizational goals and values. However, in cases like the VA scandal, where the incentives are easily manipulated and lead to unethical behavior, they can backfire and result in negative consequences. It is important to design incentive systems that promote ethical behaviors and discourage gaming.

3. The responsibility to stop incentive gaming lies with both the designers of the incentive system and the administrators who exploit it. The designers should create clear and transparent incentive structures that are difficult to manipulate, while the administrators have a responsibility to act ethically and not engage in deceptive practices for personal gain. Collaborative efforts from both parties are essential to prevent and address incentive gaming effectively.

4. In the case of the VA, incentives could be structured in a way that focuses on a range of performance metrics beyond just wait times. For example, quality of care, patient satisfaction, and staff morale could be included in the incentive system to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation of performance. Additionally, implementing checks and balances, regular audits, and whistleblower protection can help detect and prevent abuses of the incentive system.

5. Other examples of incentive gaming could include:

- Sales representatives pushing unnecessary products to meet sales targets.
- Teachers focusing on test scores at the expense of holistic education.
- Financial institutions engaging in risky behaviors to achieve short-term profit goals.

In each of these cases, the incentive structures led individuals to prioritize personal gain over ethical considerations, resulting in negative outcomes for stakeholders. Recognizing and addressing the potential for gaming incentives is crucial to maintaining the integrity of incentive systems.
