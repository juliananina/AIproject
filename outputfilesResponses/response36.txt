### Discussion Questions:

1. Which approach do you think should be used to determine the ethicality of banning, or at least seriously reforming, football to reduce head trauma? Utilitarian? Deontological? Explain why and how using that approach might play out.

2. If you apply Systematic Moral Analysis to the question of whether or not it is moral to continue to support and/or play football, do you get different results for different league categories and age groups? Explain. Is there a case to be made for “justified harm” in any of these leagues? Why or why not?

3. How do we answer the question of "How much risk is too much?" in the context of football? What factors should be considered for NFL players, college players, high school players, and under-14 players? Is this question an ethical issue, a policy issue, a political issue, or all three? Explain.

4. In light of ongoing uncertainties in the science surrounding the effects of concussions in football, how should decisions be made about reforming or abolishing the sport? How does this decision-making process relate to the balancing of lives and livelihoods?

5. When faced with a lack of concrete proof regarding the causal link between concussions and adverse health outcomes, what is the proper approach to the debate about football's safety measures? Discuss the burden of proof, the persuasive arguments, and whether this is primarily an ethical or policy issue.

6. Are politics intertwined with ethics in the debate over football safety, as shown by statements made by Presidents Obama and Trump? How do political stances influence the perception of safety measures in sports?

7. Do you find the argument that risk is present in all activities, such as riding a bicycle, to justify the potential risks associated with playing football persuasive? How does the source of this argument impact its credibility?

8. Should individual choice be prioritized in high-risk sports like football, or is there a case for paternalism to protect players from potential long-term health consequences? Discuss the implications of individual choice, including its impact on society and healthcare systems.
